# Front-End Plan — The Developer's Cockpit

How we evolve the existing static HTML dashboard into a robust,
typed, component-driven single-page application that exposes
**every** capability of the platform — data, indicators, screener,
backtests, agents, MCP tools, monitoring — in one cohesive UI.

**Status:** plan only. No code written yet.

**Goal:** a developer-first cockpit built to **production-grade
modular standards** so it can graduate into a subscription product
later without a rewrite. For now you're the only user — but every
abstraction we introduce is designed so adding multi-tenancy, auth,
billing, and quotas is a *purely additive* change, not a rip-up.

This is the explicit two-mode contract:

| Mode | When | What's different |
|---|---|---|
| **Single-tenant dev mode** | Today | No login, no tenant context, your local machine, all data yours by construction |
| **Multi-tenant SaaS mode** | Future | Login wall, tenant-scoped everything, per-tenant quotas, billing, audit log |

The same codebase serves both. Every page, every API call, every
piece of persisted state goes through abstractions (`useCurrentUser`,
`tenantId`, `withQuota`) that are no-ops in dev mode and load-bearing
in SaaS mode. See §7 (SaaS-Readiness Contract) for the seams.

**Companion docs:**
- [trading_subsystem_design.md](trading_subsystem_design.md) — strategy
  framework backing the Backtest + Runs pages.
- [data_platform_plan.md](data_platform_plan.md) — bronze/silver/gold
  surfaces backing the Lake + Coverage pages.
- [indicator_exposure_design.md](indicator_exposure_design.md) —
  IndicatorReader behind the Indicators + Symbol pages.
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — service map (the Status page
  visualizes this live).

## 1. Where we are today

Three static HTML files served by FastAPI as `FileResponse`:

| Page | Source | Stack | Lines | Calls (`fetch`) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `/dashboard` | [app/static/dashboard.html](../app/static/dashboard.html) | Alpine.js + Tailwind CDN + Lightweight Charts | 41,099 | 2 |
| `/symbol/{ticker}` | [app/static/symbol.html](../app/static/symbol.html) | Alpine.js + Tailwind CDN + Lightweight Charts | 30,525 | 2 |
| `/journal` | [app/static/journal.html](../app/static/journal.html) | Alpine.js + Tailwind CDN | 22,368 | 5 |

What's exposed in UI today: market tape, watchlist, recent signals,
basic symbol chart, journal sync, daily P&L, monitor controls.

**What's NOT exposed but should be:**

| Backend capability | API surface | UI today |
|---|---|---|
| Backtest runner | `POST /api/backtest` (TA-1+) | none |
| Screener | `POST /api/screener/scan` (TA-4.3) | none |
| Indicator series + chart data | `GET /api/indicators/series`, `POST /api/indicators/chart-data` (TA-3.2) | partial |
| Iceberg bronze browser | `GET /api/lake/bars`, `GET /api/lake/symbols`, `GET /api/lake/last-day` | none |
| Bronze coverage / gap heatmap | `GET /api/backfill/coverage`, `GET /api/backfill/gaps` | gap count only |
| Backfill controls (5 modes) | `POST /api/backfill{,/deep,/daily,/intraday,/gaps}` | none |
| Movers | `GET /api/movers` | none |
| Instruments search | `GET /api/instruments/search` | none |
| MCP tool introspection + invocation | 29 MCP tools on `/mcp` | none |
| Strategy run history (`agent_runs`) | MCP `list_strategy_runs` only | none |
| Multiple watchlists CRUD | `GET/POST /api/watchlists`, `/api/watchlists/{name}/members` | single default watchlist only |
| Service health / startup | nothing dedicated (just `/health`) | one bool flag in header |

The static-HTML approach has hit its scaling ceiling. The dashboard
is ~41k lines of inline Alpine.js — every new feature compounds the
mess, there's no type safety against the (Pydantic-typed) backend,
no test coverage, no shared components, and adding npm libraries
requires hand-vendoring scripts via CDN URLs.

---

## 2. Goals & non-goals

### Goals

1. **Cover every backend capability.** If it's a Pydantic schema on
   the backend, there's a page or panel for it.
2. **Typed end-to-end.** API client and React components share types
   generated from the FastAPI OpenAPI schema. A backend schema change
   breaks the frontend build, not production.
3. **Density + speed.** Keyboard-first; command palette; dense
   tables with sortable columns; no marketing fluff. Bloomberg
   terminal feel over Robinhood polish.
4. **Live by default.** A single WebSocket pushes everything that
   changes (signals, bars, monitor state, ingestion progress); the
   UI never polls when push is available.
5. **Lift-out friendly.** The frontend lives in `frontend/` (a sibling
   of `app/`), runs via Vite in dev, builds to `app/static/dist/` for
   production. The day we split front-end and back-end into separate
   containers, that's an nginx config change, not a refactor.
6. **MCP-introspective.** First-class UI for listing MCP tools,
   inspecting their schemas, and invoking any of them with
   form-generated args — this is how the agent surface stays
   debuggable as it grows.

### Non-goals (explicit) — for now

- **Don't build a marketing/landing page yet.** Defer until SaaS
  gating. The cockpit IS the product surface today.
- **Don't optimize mobile-first.** Desktop is the dev target. The
  layout primitives we pick (CSS grid, container queries, sidebar
  drawer pattern) are mobile-capable so the future SaaS push doesn't
  re-architect anything; we just don't *invest* in mobile until users
  appear.
- **Don't implement auth UI / login flow.** But — **DO** scaffold
  the auth seam (`useCurrentUser` hook, FastAPI dependency
  injection, tenant-scoped DB queries). See §7. Adding a real auth
  provider later becomes wiring up the seam, not rewriting pages.
- **Don't implement billing or quota enforcement.** Same logic — the
  *seam* exists (every long-running operation flows through a
  `withQuota` decorator that's a no-op today); the enforcement is
  the SaaS-mode flip.
- **Don't pursue strict accessibility / WCAG audit.** WCAG-AA color
  contrast + keyboard navigation are free side-effects of shadcn/ui
  + Radix; we get them without effort. Screen-reader testing waits
  for real users.
- **No SSR / Next.js.** API-backed cockpit; no SEO. Adding SSR
  doubles ops complexity for zero benefit. If we ever need a
  marketing/landing site, that's a *separate* Next.js site at the
  marketing subdomain — the cockpit SPA stays its own deployable.

---

## 3. Stack decisions (recommendation + rationale)

After surveying the field, my recommendation:

| Concern | Recommendation | Why this and not the alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | **React 18 + TypeScript** | Largest financial-widget ecosystem (Lightweight Charts has first-class React bindings); broadest hireable knowledge if you ever want help; type system catches the most bugs. Considered Svelte (smaller bundles, lower ceiling for our complexity) and Vue (good but smaller financial-widget ecosystem). |
| Build | **Vite 5** | Fastest dev HMR I've used; minimal config; the new default for any React-without-SSR app. Not Webpack (slow), not Parcel (less library support). |
| Routing | **TanStack Router** | Type-safe routes derived from file paths; works with code-splitting; better than React Router for typed cockpit apps. React Router would also be fine — flag for revisit if TanStack churns. |
| Server state | **TanStack Query (React Query)** | Caching, deduplication, polling, optimistic updates, WS integration. The standard. Without this you reinvent it badly. |
| Client state | **Zustand** | Minimal, no Redux ceremony. Used only for cross-page UI state (theme, sidebar, command palette). All server state goes through TanStack Query. |
| Component library | **shadcn/ui** (Radix + Tailwind, code-copied not npm'd) | We own every component file → infinite customization. The "Bloomberg terminal" aesthetic we want isn't off-the-shelf in any kit. Considered Mantine (good, but theming lock-in) and Material UI (wrong aesthetic, heavy). |
| Tables | **TanStack Table** | Headless, virtualized, sortable, filterable. The benchmark for dense data tables. |
| Charts (financial) | **Lightweight Charts** (already in use) | TradingView's; what we already render with; first-class React bindings. |
| Charts (general) | **Recharts** | For equity curves, metric dashboards, non-OHLCV. Simple, React-native, good defaults. |
| Forms | **react-hook-form + Zod** | Zod schemas can MIRROR our Pydantic models. The end-to-end type chain becomes Pydantic → OpenAPI → openapi-typescript → Zod → React Hook Form. Type-safety boundary collapses to zero. |
| API codegen | **openapi-typescript** + **openapi-fetch** | Reads FastAPI's `/openapi.json`, emits typed client. Generate-on-build (no manual regeneration). Considered the heavier `openapi-generator` — it produces too much code; openapi-typescript is the modern minimal pick. |
| Styling | **Tailwind 3** (proper install, not CDN) | We already use Tailwind. The CDN version blocks dev tooling — installing properly unlocks Tailwind plugins + IntelliSense. |
| State persistence | **localStorage** via Zustand `persist` | For panel layouts, recently-used symbols, screener spec drafts. No backend involvement needed. |
| Testing | **Vitest + Testing Library + Playwright** | Vitest = jest-compatible, Vite-native. Testing Library for component tests. Playwright for the handful of end-to-end smokes (run a screener, see results). |
| Lint / format | **biome** | Single tool replacing ESLint + Prettier. 10× faster, one config file. (Could fall back to ESLint+Prettier if biome's React support hits limits — easy swap.) |
| Icons | **lucide-react** | Open-source, large set, tree-shaken. |

### Strong alternative for consideration: **HTMX + Jinja**

If the React stack feels heavy, the legitimate alternative is
HTMX + server-rendered Jinja templates from FastAPI. Pros:
no JS framework, no build step, no codegen, no separate frontend
folder. Cons: weaker for the "cockpit" patterns we want (command
palette, persistent global state, optimistic updates on
long-running operations like backtests), and harder to extract into
its own deployable when the time comes. **For a Bloomberg-terminal
ambition, React wins. For a "make the existing dashboard cleaner"
ambition, HTMX wins.** Flagging — your call, plan below assumes React.

```

**The type chain is closed:** Pydantic → OpenAPI → TypeScript →
components. A backend schema change makes the frontend build red,
catching the integration break at CI time rather than runtime.

### 4.3 Build + deployment

- **Dev mode:** `cd frontend && npm run dev` starts Vite on port
  5173 with HMR; Vite proxies `/api`, `/mcp`, `/ws/*` → `http://localhost:8000`
  (the FastAPI process). Type generation runs in watch mode against
  `/openapi.json`.
- **Production:** `cd frontend && npm run build` produces
  `app/static/dist/`. FastAPI's existing static-mount serves it.
  `/` redirects to `/app` (the SPA shell); `/legacy/dashboard` stays
  available pointing at the old `dashboard.html` for the transition
  period.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions adds a `frontend-build` job. Fails on
  TS errors, lint errors, or test failures. Same image; npm install
  + vite build run as Docker build steps.
- **Versioning:** the SPA bundle hash gets exposed as
  `/api/health/version` so we can verify which build is deployed.

### 4.4 The legacy bridge

The existing static HTML pages (dashboard, symbol, journal) keep
working unchanged at `/legacy/*` routes for the entire transition.
We don't delete them until the React version of every page reaches
**parity + 1** (parity meaning "everything the old page does, the new
one does" + one new capability the legacy version can't deliver).
This is the discipline that turns a "rewrite" into a "migration."

---

## 5. The page catalog (the cockpit)

Each page is one TanStack Router file under `frontend/src/routes/`.
Listed roughly in priority order, with the existing static-HTML
predecessor and the new capabilities it unlocks:

### 5.1 `/` — Status (NEW)

System-wide health at a glance. Replaces the static dashboard's
single ClickHouse/Stream pill with a dense, live view of every
subsystem.

- ClickHouse, Iceberg/Glue, S3, Schwab, Polygon health (color pills).
- Live ingestion rate per source (bars/sec by provider).
- Bronze + silver freshness per symbol (heatmap).
- Backfill queue: in-flight jobs + ETA.
- Monitor service: started monitors, signal rate, error counts.
- Service-map mini-diagram (read from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` service list).
- Live "log tail" stream over WS (last 50 INFO/ERROR lines from
  the FastAPI logger).

Powered by: `/health`, `/stats`, `/api/backfill/status`,
`/monitors`, `/api/lake/last-day` (existing); + 1 new endpoint
`/api/health/services` (composite).

### 5.2 `/symbol/{ticker}` — Symbol (PARITY + extensions)

Successor to `symbol.html`. OHLCV candlestick + indicator overlay
+ signals/divergence + Iceberg-bronze coverage strip + journal
trades on that ticker.

- Interval picker (1m..1d).
- Indicator panel: stack any indicator from `/api/indicators/series`
  with live overlay (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, ATR, Bollinger, …).
- Signal markers (regular + hidden divergence) on chart.
- Recent bars table beneath chart (TanStack Table).
- Coverage strip (per-day green/yellow/red bar count vs expected).
- Journal trades on this ticker (in-page).
- "Open in MCP" button → jumps to MCP page pre-populated with
  `get_chart_data(symbol=…)`.

Powered by: existing routes; one new combined `/api/symbol/{ticker}/overview`
to reduce roundtrips on first paint.

### 5.3 `/screener` — Screener (NEW)

Visual builder for `ScreenerSpec`. Live-runs the scan. Each
candidate gets a mini sparkline.

- LHS: spec builder (universe / interval / rules / rank).
  - "Add rule" dropdown showing the 13 RuleKinds with form fields
    auto-generated from the Pydantic schema's `params`.
  - Save spec drafts to localStorage.
  - Sample-specs library (the example specs from
    `app/services/screener/README.md`).
- RHS: candidates table with sparklines.
  - Click candidate → opens `/symbol/<ticker>` in a side panel.
- Result diagnostics: universe size, n passed, errors list.

Powered by: `POST /api/screener/scan` (TA-4.3, just landed).

### 5.4 `/backtest` — Backtest (NEW)

Run a backtest from the UI. Show the equity curve, trade log,
metrics, write to `agent_runs` registry.

- LHS: strategy picker + parameter form (each strategy's
  `Params` Pydantic class auto-generates the form via Zod).
- Universe, interval, date range, starting cash, fees model.
- "Run" button → POSTs to `/api/backtest`, streams progress via WS
  if available, shows equity curve + drawdown + metrics on completion.
- "Save as agent run" button → writes to `agent_runs` (also auto
  on run completion for reproducibility).
- "Replay this run" button on completed runs → re-executes with
  pinned snapshot_id to verify determinism.

Powered by: `POST /api/backtest`, the MCP `run_backtest` tool, and
`list_strategy_runs` (existing).

### 5.5 `/indicators` — Indicators (PARTIAL → PARITY)

Multi-symbol, multi-indicator comparison. Currently the only
indicator UI is on the Symbol page.

- Pick symbols (multi), pick indicators (multi), pick interval.
- Grid view: rows = symbols, columns = indicators.
- Hover any cell → detail popover (full series chart).
- "Send to chart" sends an indicator series to overlay on a
  symbol chart.

Powered by: `GET /api/indicators/series`, `POST /api/indicators/chart-data`.

### 5.6 `/lake` — Iceberg Lake Browser (NEW)

Browse the bronze tier. List tables, view snapshots, view per-symbol
bar counts per day, run ad-hoc PyIceberg queries.

- Catalog browser: `bronze.polygon_minute` etc. with row count,
  snapshot count, last write time.
- Per-symbol bar count over time (heatmap).
- Snapshot history per table — click snapshot → diff against latest
  (rows added/removed per day).
- Ad-hoc PyIceberg query box (read-only; result table; no DML).

Powered by: `GET /api/lake/symbols`, `GET /api/lake/bars`,
`GET /api/lake/last-day`, MCP `get_bronze_table_stats`,
`get_lake_freshness`.

### 5.7 `/coverage` — Coverage / Gaps (PARTIAL → PARITY)

Per-symbol bar-coverage heatmap. Find and fill gaps.

- Heatmap: rows = symbols, columns = days, color = % of expected bars.
- Click cell → bar-by-bar detail for that (symbol, day).
- "Backfill this gap" → POSTs to `/api/backfill/gaps` with the
  resolved window.
- "Backfill all red cells" bulk action.

Powered by: `GET /api/backfill/coverage`, `GET /api/backfill/gaps`,
`POST /api/backfill/gaps`.

### 5.8 `/runs` — Strategy Runs (NEW)

Browse the `agent_runs` ClickHouse table. Reproducibility audit.

- Sortable table of runs: strategy, version, symbols, window,
  return, Sharpe, max DD, n_trades, snapshot_id, git_sha.
- Filter by strategy name, by symbol, by date range.
- Click run → expanded view: full metrics + trade log + config.
- "Replay" button → re-runs the same `(strategy_version, config, snapshot_id)`
  triple and asserts identical metrics row (the reproducibility
  test from the strategy framework).
- Side-by-side compare of any 2 runs (metrics diff, equity-curve
  overlay).

Powered by: MCP `list_strategy_runs` + new `GET /api/runs` HTTP
route (this becomes the first HTTP-side replication of an MCP-only
read; same `RunMetrics` schema both surfaces).

### 5.9 `/journal` — Trade Journal (PARITY)

Successor to `journal.html`. Same functionality, polished.

Powered by: existing `/api/journal/*` routes.

### 5.10 `/monitors` — Monitors (PARTIAL → PARITY)

Currently exposed via dashboard sidebar. Promote to full page.

- Per-symbol monitor state, signal rate, error rate.
- Start/stop monitors individually.
- View detector config per monitor (read-only; settings are env).

### 5.11 `/watchlists` — Watchlists (PARTIAL → PARITY)

CRUD on multiple watchlists. Drag-drop member management.

- List all active watchlists.
- Create/rename/delete (soft).
- Add/remove members (with normalization preview — `mnqm26` → `/MNQM26`).
- "Use as screener universe" button.
- Members table includes live last-price column (the market banner
  data per member).

Powered by: full `/api/watchlists/*` route family (existing but
unused by current UI).

### 5.12 `/mcp` — MCP Tool Explorer (NEW; agent dev surface)

This is the unique feature that justifies the whole cockpit. List
every MCP tool. Inspect its schema. Invoke it with form-generated
args. See the typed response rendered as JSON or auto-rendered
(charts for chart-data, tables for bar lists, etc.).

- Sidebar: tree of 29 MCP tools by category (lake, live, sim,
  indicators, screener, …).
- Main: selected tool's JSON-schema input rendered as form,
  output renderer auto-picked from the response shape.
- Recent invocations log (localStorage, last 50).
- "Replay" any previous invocation.
- Direct interrogation: simulate what an LLM agent sees.

This page becomes the truth surface for "what can my agent see?"
during agent development. As 29 tools grow to 60+ over the next
phases (silver readers, EW state, RL controls), having one place to
introspect them is the difference between "agent dev is tractable"
and "agent dev is dark archaeology."

Powered by: MCP `tools/list` + `tools/call` via the JSON-RPC
transport at `/mcp`.

### 5.13 `/settings` — Settings (NEW)

UI-only settings (panel layouts, theme, default interval, default
universe). Plus a read-only view of the `app/config/settings.py`
runtime values that don't contain secrets.

---

## 6. Cross-cutting features

### 6.1 Command palette (`⌘K`)

Jump-anywhere. Fuzzy match against:
- All pages
- All ticker symbols in any watchlist
- All MCP tools
- Saved screener specs
- Saved backtest configs
- Recent agent runs

This is the developer-cockpit signature. One keystroke, three
characters, you're anywhere.

### 6.2 Keyboard shortcuts

- `gd` / `gs` / `gb` / `gm` — go to dashboard / screener / backtest / MCP
- `/` — focus the ticker search
- `?` — keyboard shortcut help overlay
- `Esc` — close modal / drawer

### 6.3 Theme

Dark by default (matches current static dashboard). Light theme
optional but lower priority. Color tokens encoded via Tailwind
CSS variables so component-level theming is automatic.

### 6.4 Real-time channel (one WS, many topics)

Currently we have `/ws/signals` only. Plan:

- Promote to `/ws/events` (versioned, generic).
- Topic-based subscriptions: `signals`, `bars.{symbol}`,
  `monitors.{symbol}`, `backfill.progress`, `backtest.progress`,
  `mcp.invocations`.
- Frontend `useWebSocket(topic)` hook integrates with TanStack
  Query so receiving a `bars.AAPL` push invalidates the relevant
  query cache automatically.
- No polling for anything that emits push events.

### 6.5 Optimistic updates

For mutations (add watchlist member, start a monitor, fire a
backfill), TanStack Query optimistically updates the cache and
rolls back on server error. Cockpit feels snappier; failures are
loud.

### 6.6 Telemetry-style internal log panel

Bottom drawer with the last N log lines from the FastAPI process,
streamed via a new `/ws/logs` topic. Filterable by level + logger
name. Helps debug "why didn't this fire?" without `tail -f` in a
separate terminal.

## 7. SaaS-Readiness Contract

The single most important architectural commitment of this plan:
**every abstraction we use today is the same abstraction the SaaS
version uses.** Dev mode is "every value is `null` / `default` /
no-op" mode. SaaS mode is "values get populated by middleware."
No code path branches on `if SAAS_MODE`.

This section documents every seam. Adding multi-tenancy, auth,
billing, and per-tenant quotas later is a matter of *implementing*
each seam — not introducing new ones.

### 7.1 The single-tenant / multi-tenant boundary

Three categories of data + state. Each has a clear future migration:

| Category | Examples | Today | Future SaaS |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Platform-global** | Bronze tables, indicator math, MCP tool schemas, market hours, instrument catalog | Public to everyone | Public, unchanged |
| **Tenant-scoped** | Watchlists, screener spec drafts, backtest configs, journals, agent runs, MCP invocation history, UI prefs | One implicit "owner" (you) | Tagged with `tenant_id`; only visible to that tenant |
| **Per-user-in-tenant** | Last-viewed symbol, command-palette history, panel layout | Browser localStorage | Same + cross-device sync |

The plan: **tag the tenant-scoped category from day one** with an
explicit `owner_id` column on every relevant table. In dev mode the
column defaults to a single sentinel value (`"default"`). In SaaS
mode the auth middleware populates it.

### 7.2 Backend seams (FastAPI side)

Even though this is the *frontend* plan, the seams have to exist on
both sides. The corresponding backend work goes into the journal as
companion phase **TA-SaaS** (not yet scheduled, but spec'd here so
neither side surprises the other):

```python
# app/auth/principal.py  ← NEW
class Principal(BaseModel):
    """Who is making this request. In dev mode, always the default
    principal. In SaaS mode, derived from the auth middleware."""
    user_id: str = "default-user"
    tenant_id: str = "default-tenant"
    roles: list[str] = ["owner"]
    plan: str = "dev"  # 'dev' | 'free' | 'pro' | 'enterprise'

async def get_principal(request: Request) -> Principal:
    """FastAPI dependency. Today returns DEFAULT_PRINCIPAL.
    Tomorrow reads from session/JWT/etc."""
    return DEFAULT_PRINCIPAL
```

Every tenant-scoped route adds one dep:

```python
# app/api/routes_watchlist.py
@router.get("/watchlists")
def list_watchlists(principal: Principal = Depends(get_principal)):
    return watchlist_repo.list_watchlists(owner=principal.tenant_id)
```

Three rules that hold from day one:

1. **No tenant-scoped query lacks an owner filter.** Even today, with
   one tenant, every query filters by `owner_id="default-tenant"`. A
   lint check enforces this at PR time.
2. **The data layer accepts the owner column even on read.** Migration
   step at SaaS-time = backfill `owner_id` columns on existing rows
   + flip middleware on. Zero ORM/query rewrite.
3. **The Principal flows into MCP tools too.** MCP tools that touch
   tenant-scoped data (`list_strategy_runs`, `get_watchlist_members`)
   take a `principal` arg; today it's the default. The agent eventually
   gets a per-tenant agent identity in SaaS mode.

### 7.3 Frontend seams (React side)

```typescript
// frontend/src/auth/useCurrentUser.ts
export function useCurrentUser(): CurrentUser {
  // Today: returns DEV_USER. Tomorrow: reads from an auth context
  // wrapped around the router root.
  return DEV_USER;
}

// frontend/src/api/client.ts
export const apiClient = createClient<paths>({
  baseUrl: API_BASE,
  // Today: no-op. Tomorrow: adds Authorization header.
  fetch: withAuth(fetch),
});
```

Persisted state goes through one abstraction:

```typescript
// frontend/src/lib/storage.ts
// Today: localStorage with key `stockalert:{userId}:{key}`
// Tomorrow: cloud-synced via /api/me/prefs with same key
export function useUserSetting<T>(key: string, default: T): [T, (v: T) => void] {
  const user = useCurrentUser();
  // ...
}
```

Routes that need to be protected later are pre-marked:

```typescript
// frontend/src/routes/watchlists.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/watchlists')({
  meta: { protected: true },   // ← no-op today, gates redirect tomorrow
  component: WatchlistsPage,
});
```

### 7.4 Public API vs Cockpit API separation

Two endpoint families, with explicit naming:

| Prefix | Audience | Stability | Versioning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/v1/...` | **External**: the future SaaS REST API. Stable; semver. Documented OpenAPI. Auth required in SaaS mode. | High; breaking change = new major version | `/api/v1`, `/api/v2`, ... |
| `/cockpit/...` | **Internal**: the React SPA. Whatever shape is most efficient for the UI (composed responses, etc.). Same auth gating but UI-shaped, not API-product-shaped. | Medium; can break with cockpit deploy | None (deploys together with the SPA) |
| `/mcp/...` | **Agent surface**: MCP tools. Same Pydantic contracts as `/api/v1` to keep the agent surface a first-class citizen. | High; matches `/api/v1` | Matched to `/api/v1` |

Today we have only `/api/*`. The plan rebases existing routes onto
`/api/v1/*` (one-shot rename) and adds a new `/cockpit/*` family for
UI-composed endpoints (the "give me everything for the Symbol page
in one call" pattern) when needed. The MCP server already lives at
`/mcp` — kept as-is. The historical static-HTML pages keep working
behind `/legacy/*`.

**Why this matters:** when SaaS lands, you don't have to retroactively
classify which endpoints are public, which are cockpit-internal, and
which are agent. They're already separated by URL prefix and naming
discipline.

### 7.5 Feature flags

Every gated capability flows through one provider:

```typescript
const canRunBacktest = useFeatureFlag('backtest.runner');
const llmModel = useFeatureFlag('strategy.llm.model', 'claude-sonnet-4');
```

Today: flags resolve from a static config file (`frontend/src/flags.ts`).
Tomorrow: flags resolve per-tenant from a flags service (LaunchDarkly,
or our own table). Same `useFeatureFlag` signature.

This is how the eventual "Pro tier unlocks the RL agent" gating works
without touching component code.

### 7.6 Quotas + cost controls

Long-running operations (backtests, screener scans over wide universes,
LLM strategy runs) flow through a quota seam:

```typescript
// frontend
const { mutate, isPending, quotaInfo } = useQuotaMutation('backtest.run', {
  // ...
});
// quotaInfo.remaining_today, quotaInfo.plan_limit, etc.
```

```python
# backend
@router.post("/api/v1/backtest")
async def run_backtest(
    config: BacktestConfig,
    principal: Principal = Depends(get_principal),
    quota: QuotaCheck = Depends(check_quota("backtest.run", cost=1)),
):
    ...
```

Today: `check_quota` always returns OK. Tomorrow: it checks the
tenant's plan, decrements counters, returns 429 with quota-info
headers when exceeded. **The cost-control machinery we already use
for the LLM agent (the SQLite cache + per-run budget cap in
[app/services/sim/strategies/llm_agent.py](../app/services/sim/strategies/llm_agent.py)
TA-2) is the same pattern, applied earlier in the stack.**

### 7.7 Observability + audit (built in from day 0)

Three subsystems, hooked to no-op providers today, real providers in
SaaS mode:

| Subsystem | Today | SaaS mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Error tracking** | Console + a `useErrorBoundary` fallback page | Sentry (or PostHog) wired to the same boundary |
| **Audit log** | `app/audit/log.py` writes structured rows to a CH `audit_events` table (already useful for dev — "what did I do yesterday?") | Same table, tenant-scoped; per-tenant audit export |
| **Usage metrics** | Same `audit_events` table feeds a `/usage` cockpit page | Per-tenant usage dashboards; basis for billing |

The audit log lands **today**, not later. Every cockpit page emits
a `view` event; every mutation emits an action event; every MCP
invocation emits a tool-call event. This is operator-debuggable value
on day 1 ("why did the screener fire 50 times yesterday?") and becomes
the SaaS audit trail without re-architecture.

### 7.8 Branding + theming

White-labeling later is purely additive:

- All color tokens, the logo SVG, and the product name live in one
  config file (`frontend/src/branding.ts`).
- Every component reads from that file, not from hardcoded strings.
- Today: hard-coded "StockAlert" / current slate-and-indigo palette.
- Future: branding swappable per-tenant or per-deployment without
  recompiling.

### 7.9 Deployment topology readiness

The current FastAPI + ClickHouse + Iceberg stack is single-process,
single-box. SaaS-grade deployment needs:

| Concern | Today's posture | Future-ready means |
|---|---|---|
| Stateless API tier | Mostly true — state lives in CH + S3 + SQLite | Move the LLM response cache out of local SQLite to CH (planned anyway for replay-across-machines reproducibility) |
| Background workers | In-process asyncio tasks | Externalize to a queue (Redis Streams or NATS); workers as separate processes. Schemas already typed. |
| WebSocket fan-out | Single process | Pub/Sub via Redis when we cross 1 instance |
| Database per-tenant isolation | Single CH cluster | Either shared schema with `owner_id` filter (planned) OR per-tenant tables (only if compliance demands it). The owner-column-everywhere discipline supports both. |

We are **not** doing any of this work now. We are flagging it so the
choices we make today (e.g. where the LLM cache lives) don't paint
us into a corner. The data-platform plan already covers most of this
(silver/gold are designed multi-tenant-friendly because Iceberg's
partition-by-something model maps cleanly to `partition by owner_id`).

### 7.10 The minimum-viable-additions for SaaS launch (one-day-rough estimate)

When the SaaS day arrives, the work to flip the switch (assuming
the seams above are in place):

| Item | Effort |
|---|---|
| Auth provider integration (Clerk / Supabase Auth / WorkOS) | 1 day |
| Backfill `owner_id` on existing tenant-scoped tables (CH migration) | 0.5 day |
| `get_principal` reads from session/JWT | 0.5 day |
| Feature-flag provider integration | 1 day |
| Stripe (or Lemon Squeezy) billing webhook handler | 2 days |
| Quota-table + decrement logic on plan-gated endpoints | 1 day |
| Public landing page on marketing subdomain (Next.js, separate repo) | 3-5 days |
| SOC2 minimums (audit log already exists, just need retention + access policies) | 2 days |
| **Total** | **~2 weeks** |

Without the seams: that same flip is a 6-8 week refactor. **The
seams cost us approximately 3% extra effort today for a 5× cost
reduction on the SaaS-flip day.**

---

## 8. Type chain — the closing of the loop (Pydantic → React)

The single most important architectural property of this plan:

```
app/services/screener/schemas.py        (Python: Pydantic)
       │
       ▼
FastAPI /openapi.json                   (runtime schema export)
       │
       │  build step:
       │    npx openapi-typescript /openapi.json -o src/api/types.gen.ts
       ▼
frontend/src/api/types.gen.ts           (TypeScript types — ALL endpoints)
       │
       ▼
import { paths, components } from './types.gen'
const client = createClient<paths>()
       │
       ▼
client.POST('/api/screener/scan', { body: spec })   // ← spec typed end-to-end
```

The same chain extends to Zod schemas for forms:

```
ScreenerSpec (Pydantic)
       │
       │  openapi-typescript → ScreenerSpec (TS interface)
       │  ts-to-zod          → screenerSpecSchema (Zod)
       ▼
react-hook-form({ resolver: zodResolver(screenerSpecSchema) })
       │
       ▼
SubmitHandler → POST /api/screener/scan → typed response
```

The frontend never declares its own version of a backend type.
Diverge from this rule and you're back to the manual-sync hell that
killed the static-HTML approach.

---

## 9. Phasing

Each phase delivers operator-visible value and leaves the app in a
shippable state. Total estimated effort: 5-7 weeks of focused work
for FE-1..FE-10 (the cockpit), plus FE-11..FE-13 (~1-2 weeks) which
land the SaaS-readiness seams alongside. The seams are **threaded
through** the cockpit phases, not deferred — see notes on each phase.

### Phase FE-1 — Foundation + Status page + seams (6–8 days)

The foundation phase lands the SaaS-readiness seams. They cost ~1
extra day here and save weeks later.

- Scaffold `frontend/` with Vite + React + TS + TanStack Router +
  TanStack Query + Tailwind + shadcn/ui base components + biome.
- Wire OpenAPI codegen (npm script + watch mode).
- WebSocket subscription manager.
- App shell: sidebar nav + topbar + global status bar.
- **`/` Status page** with all the live subsystem indicators
  (§5.1).
- **SaaS-readiness seams** (§7):
  - `useCurrentUser` hook + `DEV_USER` constant.
  - `apiClient` with `withAuth` no-op wrapper.
  - `useFeatureFlag` reading from `frontend/src/flags.ts`.
  - `useUserSetting` localStorage wrapper.
  - `useQuotaMutation` no-op wrapper.
  - `branding.ts` config file with color/logo/product-name tokens
    used everywhere (no hardcoded strings).
  - `protected` route metadata (no-op today).
- **Backend seams** (companion TA-SaaS-1 work, can be a separate PR
  or bundled):
  - `app/auth/principal.py` with `Principal` Pydantic + `DEFAULT_PRINCIPAL`.
  - `get_principal` FastAPI dependency.
  - Audit-log table in CH (`audit_events`) + middleware that writes
    one row per request.
  - Rename `/api/*` → `/api/v1/*` (one-shot; legacy redirects to
    new for the static-HTML transition).
- Production build → `app/static/dist/`; FastAPI redirect `/` →
  `/app`.
- Legacy bridge: old pages stay at `/legacy/*`.
- CI: frontend-build job; type errors fail the build.

**Gates:**
- `/` page renders all subsystem health badges live (WS-driven).
- Vite dev server proxies cleanly to FastAPI.
- Type codegen reproducible (CI re-generates and confirms no drift).
- Every `useCurrentUser()` call returns `DEV_USER`; every `useQuotaMutation`
  flows through the no-op wrapper.
- Audit log records every cockpit page view + mutation.

### Phase FE-2 — Symbol page parity (4–5 days)

- Port `symbol.html` to React + Lightweight Charts via the React
  wrapper.
- Interval picker, indicator overlays, signal markers, recent bars
  table.
- Coverage strip beneath the chart.
- Journal-trades-on-this-ticker panel.

**Gate:** every feature of `symbol.html` works on the new page.
Legacy URL remains accessible.

### Phase FE-3 — Screener page (3 days)

- Visual `ScreenerSpec` builder (§5.3).
- Live scan + candidate table with sparklines.
- Draft persistence via `useUserSetting('screener.drafts', [])` —
  the seam abstraction, not raw `localStorage`.
- Backend: `screener_specs` CH table gets the `owner_id` column on
  creation (always `"default-tenant"` today; ready for SaaS).

**Gate:** the example specs in `app/services/screener/README.md` can
be reconstructed in the UI builder and produce the same results as
the API direct.

### Phase FE-4 — Backtest page (4 days)

- Strategy picker, parameter form, run button, equity curve,
  metrics, trade log, save-to-`agent_runs`.
- Reproducibility "Replay" button.
- Mutation flows through `useQuotaMutation('backtest.run')` —
  no-op cost-check today; real one when SaaS lands.
- `agent_runs` CH table gets `owner_id` column (already designed
  this way in `app/services/sim/registry.py` — confirm; if not,
  add).

**Gate:** running the canary SMA backtest from the UI produces a
metrics row in `agent_runs` byte-identical to the CLI run.

### Phase FE-5 — Runs page (2 days)

- `/runs` table from §5.8.
- Side-by-side compare.

**Gate:** every TA-1..TA-4.2 historical run appears in the table
and can be replayed.

### Phase FE-6 — MCP Explorer (4 days)

- §5.12 in full.
- Auto-form generation from MCP tool JSON schemas.
- Recent invocations + replay.

**Gate:** every one of the 29 (and growing) MCP tools is invokable
from the UI with form-generated args.

### Phase FE-7 — Lake + Coverage (3 days)

- `/lake` + `/coverage` per §5.6, §5.7.
- Ad-hoc PyIceberg query box.

**Gate:** can spot a bronze gap visually and trigger a backfill for
it from the UI.

### Phase FE-8 — Indicators + Watchlists + Monitors + Journal parity (4–5 days)

- Polish the remaining pages.

**Gate:** static-HTML pages can be deleted; cockpit replaces all
legacy functionality.

### Phase FE-9 — Polish: command palette, shortcuts, light theme (3 days)

- §6.1, §6.2, §6.3.

**Gate:** ⌘K opens, fuzzy-matches across pages/symbols/tools, jumps
on Enter.

### Phase FE-10 — Real-time everywhere (2–3 days)

- Promote `/ws/signals` → `/ws/events` (topic-multiplexed).
- Backend WS publisher integrates with backfill progress + backtest
  progress + monitor state changes.
- Front-end query invalidation triggered by WS events.
- WS subscription auth: today the connection is unauthenticated;
  the WS handshake gets the same `get_principal` treatment as HTTP
  routes (in dev, returns `DEFAULT_PRINCIPAL`).

**Gate:** no polling on any page; everything updates from WS pushes.

### Phase FE-11 — Auth-provider integration (when SaaS launches; ~3 days)

The first "flip the seam" phase. Single concrete provider, not a
configurable abstraction (we resist over-engineering — pick a stack
and commit).

**Recommendation: Clerk** (or Supabase Auth as the OSS alternative).

- `get_principal` reads from a Clerk session JWT instead of returning
  `DEFAULT_PRINCIPAL`.
- `useCurrentUser` calls Clerk's `useUser()` hook.
- Routes marked `protected: true` redirect to `/login` when there's no session.
- Add `/login`, `/signup`, `/account` cockpit pages (Clerk's React
  components do most of the work).
- Owner backfill migration: every existing tenant-scoped CH row gets
  `owner_id = (your_user_id_from_clerk)`. One-shot DDL+DML script.
- WS handshake: validate JWT from query param or first message.

**Gate:** A fresh dev machine cannot access cockpit data without
logging in. Existing data still loads when you log in as yourself.

### Phase FE-12 — Plans + quotas + billing (when SaaS launches; ~5 days)

- `plans` CH table: `plan_id, name, price_cents, quotas (JSON)`.
- `tenant_plans` CH table: `tenant_id, plan_id, status, period_end, ...`.
- `quota_check` middleware actually checks: read tenant plan's quota
  for the named operation, decrement a CH counter, return 429 if exceeded.
- Stripe Checkout integration (`/api/v1/billing/checkout-session`,
  webhook handler at `/api/v1/billing/webhook`).
- `/billing` cockpit page: current plan, usage, upgrade button.
- Feature-flag provider integration: gate the RL agent, the LLM
  strategy, advanced screener rules behind plan tiers via
  `useFeatureFlag('feature.id')`.

**Gate:** the Stripe webhook creates a `tenant_plans` row; the cockpit
reflects the new plan within 1 minute; quota enforcement applies
immediately for the new tenant.

### Phase FE-13 — SOC2 minimums + audit retention (when SaaS launches; ~3 days)

- Audit-log retention policy (rolling 1 year per tenant; longer for
  paid tiers).
- Per-tenant audit export endpoint (`GET /api/v1/audit/export.csv`).
- Soft-delete instead of hard-delete on all tenant-scoped tables.
- Privacy-policy + ToS pages (cockpit footer links).
- Data-deletion endpoint (`DELETE /api/v1/me`) implementing
  scrubbing across all tenant tables (GDPR right-to-be-forgotten).

**Gate:** documented data flow for SOC2 light evidence (audit log,
access patterns, retention policy). Not a full SOC2 cert — just the
foundation that makes a future audit tractable.

## 10. Risks & open questions

### "Frontend complexity" risk

Adding a React build pipeline doubles the surface area we maintain
in this repo. Mitigations:
- Vite + biome + shadcn/ui = the modern minimal stack. No webpack,
  no eslint-plus-prettier-plus-stylelint config sprawl.
- Type codegen is hermetic — change a Pydantic schema, frontend
  build catches the break.
- Every page is a route file; we don't introduce framework patterns
  we won't use (no Redux Toolkit, no Apollo, no Next.js).

### Bundle size

Lightweight Charts + Recharts + TanStack Query + shadcn primitives
won't be small. Mitigation: code-split routes (TanStack Router
supports this natively). Initial bundle should target < 250 KB
gzipped; route bundles < 100 KB each. Monitor via `vite-bundle-visualizer`.

### Long-running operations (backtest, deep backfill)

These can take minutes. Mitigation: progress streams over the new
`/ws/events`; UI shows a progress modal that can be backgrounded;
finished jobs notify via a top-bar drawer.

### MCP tool schema variance

MCP tools have heterogeneous response shapes (some return charts,
some return tables, some return text). The MCP Explorer's
auto-renderer needs heuristics. Mitigation: per-tool "render hint"
metadata can be added to the tool decorator if the heuristics
aren't enough (lazy — only add if needed).

### Auth + multi-tenancy (the SaaS-readiness wager)

This plan bets that landing the auth/tenancy/quota/billing **seams**
in FE-1 (~1 extra day) saves a 6-8 week refactor later. The bet
fails if:
- We never go SaaS. → ~1 day overhead wasted, no harm done.
- The seams diverge from the real eventual auth provider's shape. →
  the seams are deliberately minimal (`Principal` Pydantic, `useCurrentUser`
  hook, `withQuota` decorator) so they're close to ANY provider's shape.
  Clerk / Supabase Auth / Auth0 / Authentik all expose the same
  primitives.
- The "owner_id on every tenant table" discipline slips. → enforced by
  a lint check on PR (planned for FE-1).

Track this in the journal: if we get to FE-5 without ever using the
seams (i.e. they remained no-ops the whole time), the bet is still
winning — they cost ~1 day of FE-1 effort and they're now permanent.

### When to delete the legacy HTML

Discipline: only delete when the React replacement has reached
**parity + 1** for a given page. The "+ 1" forces at least one
new capability per page so the rewrite is justified. Track per-page
in the build journal.

---

## 11. Decisions deferred until we hit them

1. **Theme tokens** — Bloomberg-style amber-on-black is iconic but
   doesn't auto-apply to charts. Decide during FE-1 (probably
   slate-darks-with-indigo-accent, matching current static dashboard).
2. **Chart library mixing** — Lightweight Charts for OHLCV;
   Recharts for everything else? Or unify on one? Decide during
   FE-2 (probably keep both; LC is irreplaceable for finance).
3. **Form library scope** — Zod schemas for forms only, or for
   runtime validation of WS messages too? Decide during FE-6 (when
   the MCP Explorer surfaces dynamic schemas).
4. **Mobile** — fully decline, or graceful degradation? Decide
   during FE-9 (probably graceful: pages collapse to single column,
   nav becomes a drawer, but no mobile-specific designs).
5. **State persistence scope** — only UI state in localStorage, or
   also cache hot query results? Decide during FE-3 (probably
   UI-only; TanStack Query handles query-cache freshness better
   than localStorage).

---

## 12. Where this fits in the overall roadmap

The frontend track is **fully independent of the silver-layer /
gold-features / EW tracks.** No frontend phase blocks or is blocked
by data-platform work. The two tracks can run in parallel without
contention.

**Recommendation:** start FE-1 in parallel with TA-5 (silver). The
Status page makes silver work observable while it's being built —
you'll watch silver populate live in the cockpit instead of
running ad-hoc CH queries.

## 13. Decision needed from operator

This plan assumes:

1. **React + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn/ui** (over HTMX, Mantine,
   or staying with Alpine). The SaaS-readiness commitment makes
   the stack-pick more lopsided — the React+TS chain gives us
   end-to-end types (Pydantic → OpenAPI → TS → Zod) that HTMX
   can't. **Confirm or pick a different combo.**

2. **Run FE-1 in parallel with TA-5 (silver), with seams included.**
   The seams cost ~1 day of FE-1 effort. Skipping them is a 6-8
   week refactor when SaaS launches. Confirm or override
   (sequential silver-first; or skip seams to save the day).

3. **Auth provider preference** when SaaS time comes.
   Recommendation: **Clerk** for fastest path (React components +
   FastAPI middleware in 2-3 hrs); **Supabase Auth** if you want
   OSS / self-hostable; **WorkOS** if enterprise SSO is in the
   roadmap. Decide before FE-1 lands the seams so the `Principal`
   shape matches the chosen provider. (No commitment now; just
   a paper choice.)

4. **MCP Explorer (FE-6) priority** — bump earlier if agent
   development is the bottleneck. Currently slotted after
   Screener/Backtest/Runs; could be moved up to FE-2 if MCP
   debuggability is the higher pain.

5. **HTMX alternative** — open offer; with the SaaS-readiness
   ambition added the React choice becomes more justified, but
   HTMX is still doable if you want to dial back ambition.

6. **Public marketing site (Next.js, separate repo)** — when SaaS
   time comes, do we want a marketing landing page (Next.js, SEO,
   marketing copy) at `stockalert.example.com` with the cockpit at
   `app.stockalert.example.com`? Or skip the marketing site and
   onboard SaaS users through GitHub / direct link? Decide before
   FE-11. (No commitment now.)
