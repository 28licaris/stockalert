# Build Journal

Progress log for the StockAlert data platform + AI trading build. One
section per phase. A phase is **not done** until every checkbox is
ticked **and** the gate test is green.

Format conventions:
- `[ ]` open, `[x]` complete, `[~]` in progress, `[!]` blocked
- Date entries are UTC and use `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- "Gate" = the single objective test that must pass before starting the
  next phase.

## Phase 0 — Infrastructure foundation

**Goal:** PyIceberg can read/write a table in `s3://stock-lake-562741918372-us-east-1-an/`
via the AWS Glue catalog.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Started:** 2026-05-14
**Completed:** 2026-05-14
**Gate:** `tests/integration/test_iceberg_connectivity.py` — 2/2 passed

### Tasks

#### Local code (no AWS access needed) — DONE
- [x] Build journal created
- [x] Add `pyiceberg` (with glue + s3fs extras) to Poetry deps
- [x] Add Iceberg/Glue settings to `app/config.py`
- [x] Update `.env.example` with Iceberg/Glue env vars
- [x] Create AWS provisioning script `scripts/provision_lake_infra.sh`
- [x] Create Iceberg catalog helper `app/services/iceberg_catalog.py`
- [x] Create connectivity test `tests/integration/test_iceberg_connectivity.py`
- [x] Pytest `integration` marker registered in `pyproject.toml`
- [x] `poetry lock` regenerated; `poetry check` passes
- [x] Test collection clean (429 tests; 3 pre-existing collection errors
      unrelated to Phase 0 — see Follow-ups below)
- [x] Full test suite excluding pre-existing failures green
      (416 passed, 6 pre-existing failures, 5 skipped — confirmed
      pre-existing via [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) and git history)
- [x] New gate test skips gracefully without AWS creds

#### Requires user (AWS-side) — DONE
- [x] AWS profile `stock-lake` configured (~/.aws/credentials)
- [x] IAM user `stock-lake-ingest` policy updated with bucket-config +
      Glue catalog perms
- [x] `.env` created from `.env.example`; `STOCK_LAKE_BUCKET=stock-lake-562741918372-us-east-1-an`,
      `AWS_PROFILE=stock-lake`
- [x] `poetry install` — pyiceberg 0.11.1 + extras installed
- [x] Provisioning script run successfully:
  - [x] S3 bucket `stock-lake-562741918372-us-east-1-an` (us-east-1, existing)
  - [x] Versioning enabled
  - [x] Public access blocked
  - [x] SSE-S3 encryption default
  - [x] Lifecycle rules applied (bronze/silver/gold tiering + multipart abort)
  - [x] Glue database `stock_lake` created
- [x] IAM policy attached (see Decision log entry 2026-05-14)

### Gate

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_iceberg_connectivity.py -v
```

Must:
1. Connect to Glue catalog with bucket warehouse path
2. Create temp table `stock_lake.connectivity_check_<timestamp>`
3. Write one row via PyArrow → append
4. Read the row back (asserts symbol=TEST, value=42)
5. Drop the table cleanly

Test skips automatically if `STOCK_LAKE_BUCKET` is unset or no AWS
credentials are discoverable.

### Hand-off steps (user)

```bash
# 1. AWS credentials — pick one
aws configure                                # IAM user (simplest)
# OR: aws sso login --profile <profile>      # SSO
# OR: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

# 2. Sanity check
aws sts get-caller-identity

# 3. Create .env from template + set bucket
cp .env.example .env
# edit: STOCK_LAKE_BUCKET=stock-lake, STOCK_LAKE_REGION=us-east-1

# 4. Pull pyiceberg into the venv
poetry install

# 5. Provision bucket + Glue (idempotent, safe to re-run)
scripts/provision_lake_infra.sh

# 6. Run the Phase 0 gate
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_iceberg_connectivity.py -v
```

When the gate is green, tick the remaining boxes above and mark
Phase 0 status complete.

### Notes
- 2026-05-14: AWS CLI installed (v2.34.45) but no creds configured;
  `.env` absent. Proceeded with local code work; AWS-side handed off.
- 2026-05-14: `pyiceberg` pinned at `>=0.7` with extras `[glue, s3fs,
  pyarrow]`. Lockfile regenerated.
- 2026-05-14: Gate run produced two transient S3 orphan dirs from
  early failed attempts (PyArrow nullability mismatch). Fixed test to
  declare `nullable=False` on the inbound PyArrow schema and added an
  explicit S3 purge in the `finally` block so subsequent runs are
  clean. Orphans removed manually.
- 2026-05-14: IAM policy includes `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration` (used
  by provisioner) but not `s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration` — confirmed
  during a read-back attempt. Not blocking; add when we need to read
  lifecycle config programmatically.

### Follow-ups (not Phase 0 blockers)
- **Pre-existing test collection errors** in `tests/test_alert_flow.py`,
  `tests/test_indicators.py`, `tests/test_websocket.py` — reference
  modules that have never existed in the repo (`app.services.alert_service`
  etc.). Date back to the initial commit `ab6e71d`. Spawn a cleanup
  later.
- **Pre-existing failures** in `tests/test_schwab_provider.py` (5
  failures) and `tests/test_watchlist_repo.py::test_watchlists_containing`
  (1 failure). Schwab failures match `schwab-chart-fields-test-drift` +
  `schwab-streamer-url-key-test-drift` already tracked in
  [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md).
  Watchlist failure not yet diagnosed.

## Phase 1 — Bronze on Iceberg

**Goal:** Replace the existing `raw/provider=*/...parquet` lake with
Iceberg tables `bronze.{provider}_{kind}` registered to Glue. Existing
daily Parquets imported via `add_files` (no rewrites).

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Started:** 2026-05-14
**Completed:** 2026-05-14
**Gate:** `tests/integration/` — 6/6 passed

### Existing data to migrate (inventoried 2026-05-14)

```
s3://stock-lake-562741918372-us-east-1-an/raw/
  provider=polygon-flatfiles/kind=minute/
    year=2021/ ... year=2026/      1,325 daily Parquets, 5+ years
```

No `polygon-flatfiles/kind=day/`, no Schwab, no Alpaca data in the lake
today — those providers only flow into ClickHouse. The bronze layer
starts with one populated table (`bronze.polygon_minute`) and empty
table shells for the others; Phase 2 starts populating them.

### Tasks
- [x] Inspect a sample Parquet to confirm schema (columns, types,
      timestamps)
- [x] Create `bronze.polygon_minute` (partition `month(timestamp)`,
      sort `(symbol, timestamp)`, target 256 MB)
- [ ] Create remaining bronze tables (deferred until their first writer):
  - [ ] `bronze.polygon_day`
  - [ ] `bronze.schwab_minute`
  - [ ] `bronze.schwab_day`
  - [ ] `bronze.alpaca_minute`
- [x] Server-side import via Athena (replaces the planned `add_files`
      flow): 2,116,310,315 rows landed in `bronze.polygon_minute`
- [x] Row-count parity check vs source (exact, after deliberate NULL
      filter)
- [x] `BronzeIcebergSink` ([app/services/bronze/sink.py](../app/services/bronze/sink.py))
      replaces `LakeSink` as the canonical writer
- [x] Existing nightly archive job
      ([nightly_lake_refresh.py](../app/services/nightly_lake_refresh.py))
      switched to `BronzeIcebergSink`
- [x] Compaction at import time: 65 files at 547 MB avg, no further
      compaction needed for historical data
- [x] **Monthly compaction CLI**:
      [scripts/compact_bronze_monthly.py](../scripts/compact_bronze_monthly.py).
      Refuses to touch months > 90 days old without `--force` (Glacier
      IR minimum-storage protection).
- [x] Pytest integration tests
      ([tests/integration/test_bronze_sink.py](../tests/integration/test_bronze_sink.py)):
      4 cases — happy path, NULL-symbol filter, unsupported provider skip,
      empty frame skip. All against a real temp Iceberg table.

### Gate
- [x] Row-count parity: source 2,116,390,512 = bronze 2,116,310,315 +
      80,197 filtered NULL-symbol rows. Exact.
- [x] File-count check: **65 files** (target was < 200).
- [x] Sample query gate: 5y AAPL bars query, **3.78 s cold**
      (target was < 10 s).
- [x] Pytest integration tests, 6/6 passing:
  - `test_catalog_lists_configured_namespace`
  - `test_iceberg_table_roundtrip`
  - `test_bronze_sink_writes_and_reads_back`
  - `test_bronze_sink_drops_null_symbol_rows`
  - `test_bronze_sink_unsupported_provider_skips`
  - `test_bronze_sink_empty_frame_skips`

### Deferred items (carry forward)

- ~~**Nightly auto-catchup for missed days.**~~ **DONE 2026-05-16.**
  Both `refresh_polygon_lake_yesterday()` and
  `refresh_schwab_bronze_yesterday()` now auto-catch-up:
  - Helper `app/services/bronze/gaps.py` exposes
    `latest_bronze_date` (ET-basis trading day, not UTC),
    `missing_weekdays`, and `yesterday_et`.
  - With `target=None`, both refresh functions query their bronze
    table, compute the missing-weekday window, and loop. Cold-start
    fallback seeds yesterday only.
  - Unit tests: `tests/test_bronze_gaps.py` (8/8 pass).
  - Bug caught + fixed during build: UTC date misclassifies
    after-hours bars; switched to ET-basis trading-day reckoning.

- **Automate monthly compaction.** Today
  [scripts/compact_bronze_monthly.py](../scripts/compact_bronze_monthly.py)
  is manual. Right way to schedule is an asyncio background loop in
  `app/main_api.py` (same pattern as `nightly_lake_refresh.run_lake_refresh_loop`),
  gated by a `BRONZE_COMPACTION_ENABLED` env var, runs on the first
  Sunday of each month at 09:00 UTC, targets the just-closed prior
  month only. Skipped at user's request for Phase 1 — revisit when
  daily file accumulation starts hurting query latency (probably
  after 3–6 months of daily appends without a manual run).

### Risks
- The current S3 provider tag is `polygon-flatfiles`, not `polygon`.
  Decided to migrate into `bronze.polygon_minute` (flat files ARE
  Polygon's authoritative SIP data) but verify the data contents match
  what live Polygon WS would produce before treating them as
  interchangeable in silver provider-precedence rules.
- Compaction rewrites file layout; expect a one-time write surge equal
  to the dataset size (~few GB). Run during off-hours.

### Results (2026-05-14, historical-import phase)

Pivoted from a laptop-side `add_files` approach to **Athena server-side
INSERT** mid-execution after discovering the home-internet bandwidth
bottleneck (8 hours estimated vs 28 minutes via Athena). The pivot
required:
1. IAM updates adding scoped Athena actions on workgroup `primary`.
2. Two SQL-dialect corrections (Hive backticks in DDL, Trino double
   quotes in DML — the same query can't use both).
3. A partition-spec fix (the source files use `date=YYYY-MM-DD.parquet`
   as a *filename*, not a sub-directory, so `year` is the only real
   partition; `date` info is inside the Parquet).
4. Dropping the global `ORDER BY symbol, timestamp` from the INSERT —
   global sort on 2.1B rows pushed past Athena's 30-min query timeout.
5. Filtering NULL-symbol rows at the boundary.

Final import metrics:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Source rows | 2,116,390,512 |
| NULL-symbol rows filtered (data-quality) | 80,197 (0.0038%) |
| Bronze rows | 2,116,310,315 (= source − filtered, exact) |
| Data files | **65** (one per month, avg 547 MB) |
| Total compressed size | 35.6 GB |
| Athena INSERT wall time | 28 min |
| Athena scan | 33 GB |
| Cost | **$0.16** |

Gate-criterion queries (Athena cold):

| Query | Wall time | Scanned |
|---|---|---|
| `count(*) WHERE symbol = 'AAPL'` (5y full history) | 3.78 s | 522 MB |
| `count(*) WHERE ts in 2024-03-15` (universe-wide) | 2.49 s | 54.6 MB |
| `count(*) WHERE symbol = 'SPY' AND ts in Q1 2024` | 1.83 s | **0.1 MB** |

The 0.1 MB scan on the range-filtered single-symbol query proves
partition pruning + row-group min/max skipping are both working. Athena's
INSERT writer (without ORDER BY) wrote files that happen to be
symbol-clustered enough that row-group stats can skip ~99% of file
content for per-symbol queries.

`OPTIMIZE … BIN_PACK` ran in 4 s as a no-op — Athena's INSERT respected
`write.target-file-size-bytes` and produced properly-sized files on the
first pass.

### Findings (2026-05-14)

**Inbound Parquet schema (consistent across 2021–2026, 3 samples):**

| Column | Arrow type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| symbol | large_string | non-null in data; nullable in metadata |
| timestamp | timestamp[ns, tz=UTC] | minute-granular, includes pre+after-hours |
| open / high / low / close | double | |
| volume | double | fractional in newer files (fractional shares) |
| vwap | double | always 0.0 — placeholder; not populated by flat files |
| trade_count | int64 | |
| source | large_string | always `"polygon-flatfiles"` |
| `__index_level_0__` | int64 | 🚫 pandas write artifact — strip on import |

**Row counts for one trading day** (full-market snapshot): 1.5M–1.9M.
~9,000–11,500 distinct symbols, growing over time.

**API spot-check vs flat files** (5 symbols × 2026-05-12, Polygon REST
v2 aggregates):

| Symbol | API rows | Parquet rows | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| AAPL | 909 | 909 | exact match |
| MSFT | 883 | 883 | exact match |
| NVDA | 959 | 959 | exact match |
| SPY | 918 | 918 | 7 pre-market `close` drifts (±$0.01–$0.02) |
| TSLA | 955 | 955 | exact match |

SPY's 7 mismatches all occur **pre-market only** (08:15–12:53 UTC, before
13:30 UTC NYSE open). Open/high/low/volume are bit-identical; only the
last-print-per-minute close shifts by a cent on thin pre-market trades.
This is standard consolidator-edge behavior between flat-file batch
aggregation and live REST aggregation. **Regular-hours data is exact.**
Acceptable for bronze (which stores "what the provider delivered");
silver's `sources_seen` + provider precedence rules will surface this
class of drift later.

---

## Phase 2 — Schwab as a second bronze provider

**Goal:** Stand up `bronze.schwab_minute` with the last 48 days of 1-minute
bars from Schwab REST, plus a nightly job that keeps it fresh. Bronze now
has two providers feeding the same canonical schema, setting up Phase 3
(silver curation) to do its job.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Started:** 2026-05-14
**Completed:** 2026-05-15
**Gate:** all integration tests green (9/9), 1.72M rows in
`bronze.schwab_minute`, Polygon-vs-Schwab agreement queryable.

### Decisions locked at phase start

- **Universe:** seed 100 (same list Polygon has, enables apples-to-apples
  comparison). Expandable later by re-running the backfill — idempotent.
- **Nightly cadence:** 22:00 UTC (= 3 PM Arizona, ~30 min after NYSE
  close). Polygon's nightly stays at 07:00 UTC.
- **Source tag:** `source="schwab"` literal in bronze rows. If a future
  Schwab live-streaming → bronze path is added, it'll use
  `source="schwab-stream"` to distinguish.
- **Sink design:** generalize `BronzeIcebergSink` to be table-agnostic
  (constructor takes the target Iceberg `Table` + an `accepted_providers`
  set) and add factory methods `for_polygon_minute()` and
  `for_schwab_minute()`. Avoids parallel classes per provider.
- **`schwab_lake_backfill.py` (writes to legacy `raw/`) stays** for now,
  but won't be used by any new code path. Marked for removal in Phase 6.

### Tasks
- [x] Add `bronze.schwab_minute` schema/partition/sort to
      [schemas.py](../app/services/bronze/schemas.py)
- [x] Add `ensure_bronze_schwab_minute()` to
      [tables.py](../app/services/bronze/tables.py)
- [x] Refactor `BronzeIcebergSink` to accept any bronze table; add
      `for_polygon_minute()` and `for_schwab_minute()` factories
- [x] New CLI [scripts/schwab_bronze_backfill.py](../scripts/schwab_bronze_backfill.py)
      — per-symbol REST pulls, rate-limited, weekend-aware
- [x] New service
      [app/services/nightly_schwab_refresh.py](../app/services/nightly_schwab_refresh.py)
      — daily asyncio background loop mirroring `nightly_lake_refresh`
- [x] Wired into [main_api.py](../app/main_api.py) startup behind
      `SCHWAB_NIGHTLY_ENABLED` env var
- [x] Integration test
      [tests/integration/test_schwab_bronze.py](../tests/integration/test_schwab_bronze.py)
      — 3 cases (write/read, provider filter, NULL filter)
- [x] Ran 48-day seed-100 backfill: **1,719,925 rows** across 33 trading
      days, 100 symbols
- [x] Athena verification queries (results below)

### Gate
- [x] 33 trading days × 100 symbols, **1,719,925 rows** in
      `bronze.schwab_minute`
- [x] Per-(symbol, day) bar counts within expected range:
      p05=386, **median=483**, p95=770. 97% of symbol-days in the
      350–800 normal range; 3% below (low-volume edge symbols or
      partial-data days).
- [x] Pytest integration suite: **9/9 passing**
      (3 new Schwab + 4 polygon + 2 connectivity)
- [x] Athena `SELECT count(*) FROM stock_lake.schwab_minute` works
      (3.2 s, 1.1 MB scanned)
- [x] Polygon-vs-Schwab agreement query produces meaningful baseline:
      AAPL last 30 days, 14,952 shared minutes, **98.6% exact close
      agreement**, 0.5% within-penny drift, 0.9% diverged (≥$0.01)
- [ ] Nightly background loop verified live (gated by user setting
      `SCHWAB_NIGHTLY_ENABLED=true` and restarting the server)

### Results (2026-05-15)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total rows | 1,719,925 |
| Trading days covered | 33 |
| Distinct symbols | 100 (full seed-100) |
| First bar | 2026-03-30 11:00 UTC |
| Last bar | 2026-05-14 23:59 UTC |
| Empty/error days | 1 (2026-04-03 — Schwab API quirk, see Risks) |
| Weekend skips | 14 |
| On-disk files | 33 (one per day, pre-compaction) |
| Total compressed size | 37.7 MB |
| Backfill wall time | 33 min |

### Polygon vs Schwab agreement (AAPL, last 30 days)

| Bucket | Bars | Share |
|---|---|---|
| Same minute in both | 14,952 | — |
| Close prices exact (Δ<$0.001) | 14,747 | **98.6%** |
| Close within penny ($0.001–$0.01) | 76 | 0.5% |
| Close diverged (≥$0.01) | 129 | 0.9% |

The 1.4% disagreement is concentrated in pre/after-hours bars (consistent
with what we saw in Phase 1's SPY drift analysis). This is the kind of
data that silver-layer curation in Phase 3 will use to pick a canonical
provider per bar.

### Known issues / follow-ups

1. **2026-04-03 missing entirely.** Schwab API returned HTTP 400 for
   every symbol on that date with the message
   `"Enddate ... is before startDate"`. This is a quirk in how
   `historical_df` combines `period=1` with explicit `startDate`/`endDate`
   on certain dates. The production live-streaming path is unaffected
   (it uses streaming, not pricehistory). To recover the missing day,
   fix the period-vs-explicit-window interaction in
   [schwab_provider.py:732 historical_df](../app/providers/schwab_provider.py),
   then re-run the backfill with `--start 2026-04-03 --end 2026-04-03`.
   Out-of-scope for Phase 2 (silver dedup handles single-provider gaps
   gracefully).

2. **No compaction yet.** 33 small files (~1 MB avg) in
   `bronze.schwab_minute`. After a few weeks of daily appends, a
   monthly compaction will be helpful. The existing
   `scripts/compact_bronze_monthly.py` is hard-coded to
   `polygon_minute` — extend to take a `--table` argument when we
   automate compaction (already on the deferred list).


## Pre-Phase 3 — Code organization & MCP scaffold

**Goal:** Get the codebase into a shape that supports the silver/gold
build AND agent (MCP) access cleanly. Three sub-steps; each its own commit.

**Status:** Step 1 complete; Steps 2 & 3 pending.

### Step 1 — Service folder reorg + startup isolation ✅ (commit `5b0655d`, 2026-05-16)

- `app/services/` grouped into domain folders:
  - `bronze/`   — Iceberg tables + sink (pre-existing)
  - `ingest/`   — nightly_polygon_refresh, nightly_schwab_refresh,
                  backfill_service, flatfiles_backfill, historical_loader,
                  sinks (Sink Protocol + ClickHouseSink + SinkResult)
  - `live/`     — watchlist_service, monitor_service, monitor_manager
  - `journal/`  — journal_sync (Schwab-only), journal_parser, pnl
  - `legacy/`   — lake_archive, lake_sink, s3_lake_client (Phase 7 removal)
- Renamed `nightly_lake_refresh.py` → `ingest/nightly_polygon_refresh.py`
  to match `nightly_schwab_refresh.py`.
- Split `flatfiles_sinks.py`: generic Sink + ClickHouseSink to
  `ingest/sinks.py`; legacy LakeSink to `legacy/lake_sink.py`.
- Each domain folder gets its own README.md per doc-discipline memory.
- `main_api.py` startup hardened with `_safe_start()`: every subsystem
  starts in isolation. Journal sync failing no longer blocks watchlist,
  nightly bronze, or HTTP routes. Foundation tasks (CH schema, batcher)
  remain non-isolated by design.
- `routes_market.py` docstring corrected — banner is provider-agnostic.
- 38 files updated for imports; 144/144 in-scope tests pass.

### Step 2 — Read services + CH-independent lake routes (IN PROGRESS)

**Why:** Today routes mostly read directly from ClickHouse, and lake
reads happen inline via PyIceberg. To support (a) agents reading the
lake without CH up, and (b) MCP tools as thin wrappers around services,
we need explicit read services with Pydantic contracts.

Sequencing: build the gate-critical path first (bronze reader + its
contract + route + gate test), then the supporting CH readers and the
existing-route refactor. Lets us validate the agent-readiness design
end-to-end before touching production-facing routes.

**Slice 1 — bronze reader + contract** (LANDED 2026-05-16)
- [x] `app/services/readers/schemas.py` — `BronzeBar`, `BronzeBarsResponse`
      Pydantic models. The contract MCP tools will reuse verbatim.
- [x] `app/services/readers/bronze_reader.py` — `BronzeReader.get_bars()`
      over `bronze.{provider}_minute` Iceberg tables. Provider routing
      via `_PROVIDER_TABLE`; half-open intervals; UTC at the boundary;
      Pydantic shape out. CH-independent.
- [x] `app/services/readers/README.md` — folder contract + roadmap of
      planned readers (`bar_reader`, `signal_reader`, `quote_service`,
      future `silver_reader`).
- [x] Integration test `tests/integration/test_bronze_reader.py` — 8
      cases against a real Glue catalog + S3 temp table: happy path,
      empty windows, unknown symbol, half-open interval edges, naive-
      datetime UTC coercion, `limit=N` returns most-recent-N,
      `ValueError` on unknown provider. AWS-free unit case passes
      locally; AWS-gated cases pending an integration run.

**Slice 2 — `/api/lake/bars` route + gate** (LANDED 2026-05-16)
- [x] `app/api/routes_lake.py` — `/api/lake/bars` over `BronzeReader`,
      `Depends(get_bronze_reader)` so tests override cleanly. Thin
      adapter; no business logic in the route.
- [x] Wired into `main_api.py` (46 routes total, up from 45).
- [x] Unit + gate test `tests/test_routes_lake.py` — 6 cases:
      happy path with response-shape assertion, empty-window 200/[],
      unknown-provider 400, infra-failure 500, missing-params 422,
      and the **structural CH-independence gate**:
      `test_lake_route_does_not_import_clickhouse` walks every
      `app.*` module transitively reachable from `routes_lake` via
      AST + `importlib.util.find_spec` and asserts NONE sit under
      `app.db.*` (ClickHouse). This regression-guards the
      CH-independence promise at the code-structure level — even if
      a future change accidentally adds a CH import to the bronze
      read path, this test will fail before production breakage.
      All 6/6 pass.
- [x] **End-to-end live verification:** booted uvicorn, curled
      `/api/lake/bars?symbol=AAPL&start=2024-08-01T14:00:00Z&end=2024-08-01T14:05:00Z&limit=5`,
      got HTTP 200 with real production AAPL bars
      (`source: "polygon-flatfiles"`, sub-second). Confirmed Pydantic
      response shape matches `BronzeBarsResponse`.

**The Phase Pre-3 Step 2 gate is GREEN.** Agent-readiness for
historical reads is proven: bronze data flows through a typed contract
without any ClickHouse code in the call path. Slices 3 and 4 below
are scope-completion (more endpoints + the CH-backed readers), not
gate-blockers.

**Slice 3 — list/discovery surface** (LANDED 2026-05-16)
- [x] `BronzeReader.list_symbols(provider, since, limit)` — distinct
      symbol scan with default 30-day window, sorted output, null/
      empty filtered out. Reads only the `symbol` column for cost.
- [x] `BronzeReader.latest_trading_day(provider, lookback_days)` —
      delegates to `bronze.gaps.latest_bronze_date` so gap-detection
      and the read surface share one source of truth. ET-basis
      trading day per the `feedback_et_vs_utc_trading_day` rule.
- [x] `GET /api/lake/symbols` route with `provider`, `since`, `limit`
      query params; echoes effective `since` (resolved default) in
      the response so consumers can record what was queried.
- [x] `GET /api/lake/last-day` route with `provider`, `lookback_days`
      query params. 200 with `latest_trading_day: null` when no rows
      exist in window (no 404).
- [x] Tests in `tests/test_routes_lake.py`: 7 new cases covering
      both routes (happy paths, default-since echo, unknown provider
      400, null-when-no-data, lookback bounds 422). Total now 13/13
      green, including the unchanged CH-independence structural gate.
- [x] **Live verification:** `/api/lake/last-day?provider=polygon`
      returned `2026-05-15` (correct — yesterday ET, matches nightly
      catch-up). `/api/lake/symbols?since=2024-08-14&limit=10`
      returned first 10 tickers alphabetically from production bronze.

**Slice 4a — CH-backed readers + provider quote service** (LANDED 2026-05-16)
- [x] `app/services/readers/bar_reader.py` — `BarReader` over CH
      `ohlcv_1m` / `ohlcv_5m` / `ohlcv_daily`. Methods:
      `get_recent_bars` (DESC → ASC flip), `get_bars_in_range`
      (interval-routes to direct or resampled query), `get_latest_bar_per_symbol`.
      Supported intervals: 1m / 5m / 15m / 30m / 1h / 4h / daily.
      Thin wrappers over `app.db.queries` — no SQL in the reader.
- [x] `app/services/readers/signal_reader.py` — `SignalReader` over CH
      `signals`. Methods: `get_recent_signals`, `get_signals_by_symbol`.
- [x] `app/services/readers/quote_service.py` — `QuoteService` over the
      `get_market_quotes_provider()` fallback chain. Async; methods:
      `get_quote(symbol)`, `get_quotes(symbols)`. Normalizes
      provider-specific field names (Schwab's `lastPrice`/`totalVolume`/
      epoch-ms `quoteTime`; Polygon's variants; etc.) into the
      canonical `Quote` shape. invalidSymbols passed through.
- [x] Pydantic schemas added to `readers/schemas.py`: `LiveBar`,
      `LiveBarsResponse`, `LatestBarsResponse`, `Signal`,
      `SignalsResponse`, `Quote`, `QuotesResponse`.
- [x] Unit tests in `tests/test_readers_unit.py` — 23 cases.
      Stubbed CH queries via `unittest.mock.patch`, stubbed provider
      for QuoteService. Covers interval routing, ASC re-sort,
      unknown-interval ValueError, empty-input short-circuits, field
      alias fall-through, Schwab epoch-ms vs ISO timestamps, missing
      `get_quotes` graceful degradation.
- [x] Combined test run (`test_readers_unit.py` + `test_routes_lake.py`):
      **36/36 green**. Production-bronze structural CH-independence
      gate still passes.

**Slice 4b — refactor existing routes to use new readers** (LANDED 2026-05-16)

Three sub-commits, each reviewable on its own:

- [x] **Prep commit:** extend `BarReader` + `QuoteService`.
      - Renamed `BarReader` interval `"daily"` → `"1d"` to match
        `queries.SUPPORTED_INTERVALS` exactly.
      - Added `BarReader.get_bars_for_chart(symbol, interval,
        lookback_days, limit)` — the multi-table fallback + auto-
        limit logic that used to live in `routes_signals./bars` now
        lives here, unit-tested in isolation.
      - Added `QuoteService.get_raw_quotes(symbols, chunk_size)` —
        returns `(merged_dict, invalid_list)` without forced
        normalization, for consumers (the banner) that need
        provider-specific fields the canonical `Quote` doesn't carry.
      - `get_quotes` and `get_raw_quotes` share a private
        `_fetch_chunked_merged` helper.
      - `_row_to_live_bar` made flexible: accepts both `ts` and
        `timestamp` row keys (different queries use different
        aliases).

- [x] **`routes_signals.py` refactor.**
      - `GET /api/signals` → `SignalReader.get_signals_by_symbol`
        via `Depends(get_signal_reader)`.
      - `GET /api/bars` → `BarReader.get_bars_for_chart` via
        `Depends(get_bar_reader)`. ~60 lines of routing/fallback
        logic deleted from the route layer.
      - Response shapes preserved verbatim for the dashboard.
      - Fixed real bug along the way: `_row_to_signal` was reading
        the wrong column names (`signal_type`/`ts_signal`/
        `price_at_signal`) when `queries.list_signals` actually
        returns short aliases (`type`/`ts`/`price`). Unit test was
        passing on stubbed (wrong) data. `_signal_row` fixture
        updated to mirror the real shape.
      - Live-verified `/api/bars?symbol=AAPL` against production CH.

- [x] **`routes_market.py` refactor.**
      - `GET /api/market/banner` → `QuoteService.get_raw_quotes` via
        `Depends(get_quote_service)`. The `_fetch_quotes_merged`
        helper deleted from the route — chunking now lives in
        `QuoteService`.
      - Banner-specific extraction (`_extract_row`) stays in the
        route because Schwab's `regularMarketNetChange` /
        `assetMainType` etc. are richer than the canonical `Quote`
        shape MCP tools will consume.
      - `routes_market.py`: 222 → 196 lines.
      - Tests migrated from `monkeypatch` of the factory function to
        FastAPI `app.dependency_overrides[get_quote_service]` — the
        idiomatic override. Added a new test for invalidSymbols
        passthrough now that it crosses the service boundary.
      - Live-verified the banner against production Schwab (SPY at
        $737.34, full asset_type/net_change/change_pct).

- [x] **`routes_watchlist.py` — deliberately NOT refactored.**
      The snapshot endpoint includes a `bar_count` field that's a
      watchlist-quality metric, not a market metric. Forcing it
      through `BarReader.get_latest_bar_per_symbol` (which only
      returns canonical `LiveBar`) would require either two SQL
      queries or a fake "with-metadata" reader variant — both worse
      than the existing direct query. Added a doc-comment in
      `_snapshot_for` documenting the decision and pointing at
      `feedback_platform_design_intent` for the principle: readers
      own the canonical contract; non-canonical metrics live next
      to the consumer that needs them.

**Final state for Step 2**

- All four planned readers live in `app/services/readers/` with one
  shared `schemas.py` contract.
- All three lake endpoints (`/api/lake/bars`, `/api/lake/symbols`,
  `/api/lake/last-day`) operate via `BronzeReader`.
- Three of four CH-bound endpoints (`/api/signals`, `/api/bars`,
  `/api/market/banner`) now go through reader services; the fourth
  (`/api/watchlists/.../snapshot`) keeps direct query access by
  design.
- Combined test surface: 87 green across reader unit tests + lake +
  market + watchlist + instruments route tests. Structural
  CH-independence gate on `routes_lake` still passes.

**Step 2 done.** Ready for Step 3 (MCP scaffold).

**Gate:** `/api/lake/bars?symbol=AAPL&start=...&end=...` returns rows
with ClickHouse stopped. Existing CH-backed routes still work normally.

### Step 3 — MCP scaffold mounted on FastAPI (IN PROGRESS)

Scope-up from the original journal plan: every read service in
`app/services/readers/` will get one tool per public method, plus
tools wrapping the watchlist/movers/instruments/coverage surfaces,
plus Schwab pass-through (options/market hours), plus system
observability. Sliced for incremental delivery.

**Slice 1 — Foundation + lake tools** (LANDED 2026-05-16)
- [x] `mcp[cli]>=1.0` added as a dependency (PyPI `mcp` package
      → `FastMCP`).
- [x] `app/mcp/server.py` — global `mcp = FastMCP("stockalert")`
      instance + `register_all_tools()` + `mount_on(app)` helper.
      Mount composes FastMCP's session-manager lifespan with the
      FastAPI lifespan so initialization is automatic.
- [x] `app/mcp/middleware.py` — `tool_call(name, **fields)` context
      manager. Logs success-with-timing, distinguishes `ValueError`
      (client problem, WARNING) from other exceptions (server bug,
      ERROR with traceback). Designed to absorb future hooks
      (auth, rate limit, cost accounting) without per-tool changes.
- [x] `app/mcp/tools/lake.py` — 3 tools backing `BronzeReader`:
      - `get_bronze_bars(symbol, start, end, provider, limit)`
      - `list_bronze_symbols(provider, since, limit)`
      - `get_latest_trading_day(provider, lookback_days)`
      Each tool: docstring with `USE WHEN`, `Args`, `Returns`, `Cost`
      sections (the LLM-visible affordance). Body is `with tool_call(...)`
      then one reader call. Returns the exact `schemas.py` Pydantic
      shape — HTTP and MCP surfaces share the contract byte-for-byte.
- [x] `app/mcp/README.md` — folder contract, planned tool surface
      table, "how to add a new tool" recipe, layering rules.
- [x] `main_api.py` mounts MCP via `_safe_start`-equivalent isolation:
      a try/except so MCP failures don't break the API. Mounted at
      `/mcp` → streamable-HTTP endpoint at `/mcp/mcp/`.
- [x] Tests `tests/test_mcp_lake.py` — 8 cases:
      - **Discovery:** `list_tools` returns 3 lake tools; descriptions
        present + one-line summaries; input schemas cover required
        + optional args.
      - **Invocation:** `call_tool(...)` against a stubbed reader
        returns the expected Pydantic shape for all 3 tools.
      - **Unknown tool:** raises (FastMCP's `ToolError`).
      - **Structural gate:** AST-walks every `app.*` module reachable
        from `tools/lake.py` and asserts none sit under `app.db.*`.
        Same pattern as `test_lake_route_does_not_import_clickhouse`
        for HTTP routes — CH-independence enforced at the code-
        structure level for the MCP path too.
      - 8/8 green.
- [x] **End-to-end live verification:** booted uvicorn, used the
      official `mcp.client.streamable_http` Python client to:
        1. Open a session,
        2. Call `list_tools()` — returns all 3 with full descriptions,
        3. Call `call_tool("get_latest_trading_day", {"provider":"polygon"})`
           — returns `{"provider":"polygon", "latest_trading_day":"2026-05-15"}`
           from production bronze, sub-second.
      This is the exact path Claude Desktop / any MCP-compatible
      agent will take. **The Phase Pre-3 Step 3 gate is GREEN for
      the bronze slice.**

**Slice 2 — Live tier + signals + quotes** (LANDED 2026-05-16)
- [x] `app/mcp/tools/live.py` — 4 tools backing `BarReader`:
      - `get_recent_bars(symbol, limit)` — newest N 1-minute bars ASC.
      - `get_bars_in_range(symbol, start, end, interval, source_table)` —
        explicit window; supports forced source_table for power users.
      - `get_bars_for_chart(symbol, interval, lookback_days, limit)` —
        chart-friendly with multi-table fallback + auto-limit.
      - `get_latest_bar_per_symbol(symbols)` — snapshot across many
        symbols at once; omits symbols with no rows.
- [x] `app/mcp/tools/signals.py` — 2 tools backing `SignalReader`:
      - `get_recent_signals(limit)` — newest N across all symbols.
      - `get_signals_by_symbol(symbol, limit)` — drill-into-one or
        all-symbols sweep with bigger default limit.
- [x] `app/mcp/tools/quotes.py` — 2 tools backing `QuoteService`:
      - `get_quote(symbol)` — single quote; returns null when
        provider can't resolve.
      - `get_quotes(symbols)` — chunked batched. `QuoteService` does
        the chunking under the hood, so this is one call from the
        agent's perspective. (Curated `get_market_banner` deferred to
        Slice 3 — needs the dashboard-shape extraction logic.)
- [x] `register_all_tools()` updated to import all 4 tool modules.
- [x] `tests/test_mcp_live.py` — 11 cases parallel to test_mcp_lake.py:
      discovery (all 8 new tools advertised + descriptions), invocation
      (each tool's stub-reader round-trip), the `Optional[Quote]`
      return-wrapping quirk pinned in two assertions.
- [x] **End-to-end live verification** via official `mcp.client`
      streamable-HTTP client (the same one Claude Desktop uses):
      - `list_tools` → 11 tools advertised
      - `call_tool("get_recent_bars", {"symbol":"AAPL","limit":3})`
        → 3 real CH bars; last at 2026-05-15 23:59, close=299.846
      - `call_tool("get_quote", {"symbol":"SPY"})`
        → last=737.34, provider=schwab (real Schwab REST call)

**The MCP agent path is live across all three tiers** — Iceberg
bronze, ClickHouse live, and Schwab REST quotes. Same Pydantic
shapes, same readers, two surfaces (HTTP routes + MCP tools).

**Slice 3 — Discovery + observability tools** (LANDED 2026-05-16)
12 new tools across 6 files. Total tool surface: 23.

- [x] `tools/watchlist.py` — 3 read-only tools:
      `list_watchlists`, `get_watchlist` (with members),
      `get_watchlist_members`.
- [x] `tools/movers.py` — `get_movers(symbol_id, sort, frequency)`.
      Schwab provider-backed; degraded-mode returns `{}` on any
      provider error so the agent path never raises.
- [x] `tools/instruments.py` — `search_instrument(query, limit)` (the
      fuzzy/ranked symbol resolver), `get_instruments(symbols, projection)`.
- [x] `tools/market.py` — `get_market_hours(market)`.
- [x] `tools/coverage.py` — the ML-quality observability layer:
      - `get_coverage(symbol, start, end, interval)` — actual vs
        regular-session-expected bar count + first/last bar timestamps.
      - `find_intraday_gaps(symbol, start, end, min_gap_minutes)` —
        contiguous missing-bar ranges, with the existing
        `queries.find_intraday_gaps_async` doing the heavy lifting.
      - `get_bronze_table_stats(table)` — row count, file count,
        snapshot ID, on-disk size for a bronze Iceberg table. Iceberg
        metadata-only; cheap regardless of table size.
- [x] `tools/system.py` — platform-self-diagnosis:
      - `get_health()` — aggregate status ('ok'/'degraded'/'down'),
        per-subsystem `ServiceStatus` rows. Pings CH + Iceberg in
        parallel via `asyncio.to_thread`.
      - `get_lake_freshness()` — per-table latest trading day for
        bronze tables. Per-table error isolation: schwab failing
        doesn't blank out the polygon entry.
- [x] New Pydantic schemas in `app/services/readers/schemas.py`:
      `WatchlistSummary`, `WatchlistDetail`, `WatchlistsResponse`,
      `CoverageReport`, `IntradayGap`, `GapReport`, `BronzeTableStats`,
      `LakeFreshnessReport`, `ServiceStatus`, `SystemHealthReport`.
      The MCP surface is now formally the same Pydantic contract
      surface that HTTP routes use — 17 models, one source of truth.
- [x] `register_all_tools()` updated; tests in
      `tests/test_mcp_discovery.py` — 18 cases including:
      - Discovery: 12 new tools registered.
      - Watchlist round-trips with stubbed `watchlist_service`.
      - Movers/instruments/market_hours with stubbed `get_provider()`.
      - Degraded-mode contract (bare provider w/o the method → `{}`).
      - Coverage % calculation across regular-session weekday-bar
        accounting (`actual / expected` rounded to 4 decimals).
      - find_intraday_gaps converting CH dicts → IntradayGap models.
      - get_bronze_table_stats error path (AWS unreachable →
        BronzeTableStats with `error` populated).
      - get_health across all three status states.
      - get_lake_freshness per-table error isolation.
- [x] **End-to-end live verification** against production data via
      `mcp.client.streamable_http`:
      - `get_bronze_table_stats(polygon_minute)`
        → 2,116,486,243 rows in 68 files, 38GB, real snapshot ID.
      - `get_lake_freshness()`
        → polygon_minute + schwab_minute both at 2026-05-15.
      - `get_health()` → status='ok', both tiers up.
      - `search_instrument("apple", 3)` → AAPL with Schwab metadata.
      - `list_watchlists()` → real watchlists.
      All 23 advertised tools accessible to any MCP client (Claude
      Desktop / Inspector / programmatic clients) right now.

**Slice 4 — Schwab pass-through** (later, lower priority)
- [ ] `tools/schwab_options.py` (option chain / expirations / option
      quote).
- [ ] `tools/journal.py` (Schwab account + trade history).

**Slice 5 — Gated writes** (its own phase, NOT before Trading AI work)
- [ ] `tools/writes.py` — watchlist mutation with allowlist.
- [ ] `tools/trading.py` — Schwab Trader API. Kill-switch protected.

**Gate (Step 3):** an LLM agent can call any read tool through MCP
and get the same Pydantic shape the HTTP route would return — proven
end-to-end with the official MCP client.

### What "done" looks like before Phase 3 (Silver)

Sign-off criteria for moving on:

1. All tests green
2. `/api/lake/bars` route returns data when CH is stopped
3. MCP `/mcp` endpoint responds to a `list_tools` call
4. Every service has a README + sits in the right domain folder
5. Legacy raw/ writer is in `legacy/` and marked for removal

---

## Phase 3 — Silver layer + corp actions

**Goal:** Build `silver.ohlcv_1m` as the canonical, deduped, gap-filled
read source for backtests and ML training. Two providers in bronze
(polygon + schwab) get merged with provider-precedence rules.

**Status:** not started. Depends on Pre-Phase 3 steps 2 + 3 being done.

Detail in [data_platform_plan.md §6](data_platform_plan.md).

---

## Phase 4 — Live → Bronze (CH 5-min flush)

**Status:** not started. Deferred — nightly bronze ingest is currently
keeping bronze fresh within T+1 which is sufficient for backtests and
training. Add when sub-day freshness in bronze becomes a real need.

---

## Phase 5 — Reader flip (dashboard reads bronze for history)

**Status:** not started. The Pre-Phase-3 Step 2 work (`BronzeReader`
service + `/api/lake/bars` route) lays the foundation; this phase
flips the dashboard's chart endpoint to prefer bronze for older data
and CH only for today's live bars.

---

## Phase 6 — Gold + ML reproducibility

**Status:** not started.

---

## Phase 7 — Retire legacy lake prefix

**Status:** not started. Triggered once Phase 3 (silver) + Phase 5
(reader flip) are stable and the `s3://.../raw/` data is provably
unreferenced.

---

## Backlog — pick up whenever

### Schwab API — full pass-through coverage

**Goal:** every Schwab Market Data + Trader API endpoint is reachable
through our system — both for HTTP routes and (once Step 3 lands) for
MCP tools so agents can use them. "Pass-through" = the user / agent can
do anything they could do hitting Schwab's API directly, but with our
auth handling, retries, and canonical response shapes.

**Currently wrapped** (in [app/providers/schwab_provider.py](../app/providers/schwab_provider.py)):

| Endpoint | Method | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `/pricehistory` | `historical_df` | nightly_schwab_refresh, backfill, agent training |
| `/quotes` | `get_quotes` | banner, dashboard |
| `/chains` | `get_option_chains` | (provider has it; not yet routed) |
| `/expirationchain` | `get_expiration_chain` | (not yet routed) |
| `/movers/{symbol_id}` | `get_movers` | routes_movers |
| `/markets` | `get_market_hours` | (not yet routed) |
| `/accounts` | journal_sync | journal pages |
| Streaming (CHART_EQUITY, LEVELONE_*) | SchwabStreamer | live watchlist |

**Gaps to close:**

- [ ] **Options data — full ingest path.** `get_option_chains` exists
      on the provider but there's no service that snapshots option
      chains into ClickHouse or bronze. Open questions:
  - What schema? `option_chains` table keyed on
    `(underlying, expiration, strike, call_or_put, snapshot_ts)`.
  - Live snapshots or daily end-of-day? Both?
  - Retention / partition — options blow up row counts fast
    (~hundreds of strikes × dozens of expirations per underlying).
  - Bronze table per provider (`bronze.schwab_option_snapshot`) +
    eventual silver merge.
- [ ] **Option price history.** Schwab supports historical option
      pricing for specific contracts. No wrapper yet.
- [ ] **Option streaming.** Schwab Streamer has option services
      (`LEVELONE_OPTIONS`, `OPTION`). Not subscribed today.
- [ ] **Trader API — order placement.** `POST /accounts/{hash}/orders`
      and cancel. Required for Trading-AI Phase 8 (paper trading) and
      Phase 9 (live).
- [ ] **Order status + history.** `GET /accounts/{hash}/orders` for
      replay / reconciliation.
- [ ] **Instruments search.** `GET /instruments?symbol=...` for
      symbol resolution and instrument-type lookup.
- [ ] **Transactions.** Already pulled by journal_sync but expose as
      a service + MCP tool for ad-hoc agent queries.
- [ ] **Streaming for futures** (`CHART_FUTURES`, `LEVELONE_FUTURES`).
      Partial support exists; no consumer wires it up.

**MCP tool surface to add** (after Step 3 scaffold lands):

```
get_option_chain(symbol, expiration?, strike_range?)
get_option_quote(option_symbol)
list_option_expirations(symbol)
get_account_positions()                ← read-only, safe for agents
get_recent_transactions(account_hash, days=30)
place_order(...)                       ← gated behind execution service
cancel_order(order_id)
```

**Design rule.** Each Schwab endpoint becomes:
1. A method on `SchwabProvider` (already mostly done — keep going).
2. A wrapper service in `app/services/` if it needs caching /
   business logic on top.
3. An optional FastAPI route in `app/api/` for human/UI use.
4. An MCP tool in `app/mcp/tools/` for agent use.

Each layer is thin — the service has the logic, route + MCP tool are
adapters. Same pattern as the rest of the codebase.

### Technical-analysis indicator library expansion

**Goal:** expand `app/indicators/` from the current three (RSI, MACD,
TSI — which is all divergence detection needs) into a full TA toolkit
that agents and strategies can pick from without pulling in external
deps. Full target list lives in
[app/indicators/README.md](../app/indicators/README.md) — momentum,
trend, MAs, volatility, volume, cycles. Each gets its own file + class
+ unit tests, following the `Indicator(ABC)` contract in
[base.py](../app/indicators/base.py). Wiring is one-line per indicator
into `INDICATOR_MAP` in `services/live/monitor_service.py`.

Not on the critical path for Phase 3 (silver). Pick up when a specific
strategy or agent needs an indicator that isn't there yet.

### Signal-detector library expansion

**Goal:** expand `app/signals/` from the current one (divergence) into
a catalog of named pattern detectors that strategies and agents can
compose. Full target list lives in
[app/signals/README.md](../app/signals/README.md) — trend reversals,
continuations, MA crossovers, threshold crossings, volatility breakouts,
volume confirmations, candlestick patterns, mean-reversion triggers.
Each gets its own file (or grouped file) + unit tests, following the
pure-function detector contract in the README. Wiring is one-line per
detector into `DETECTOR_MAP` in `services/live/monitor_service.py`.

Not on the critical path for Phase 3 (silver). Pick up when a specific
strategy needs a pattern that isn't there yet. Often paired with an
indicator add (e.g. Stochastic RSI %K/%D detector needs the Stochastic
indicator first).

### Other backlog items

- [ ] **Bronze compaction automation** — scheduled `compact_bronze_monthly.py`
      via asyncio background task or external cron. Currently manual.
      (See Phase 1 deferred items.)
- [ ] **`/health/services` JSON endpoint** — per-subsystem status,
      so dashboards / monitoring don't have to parse logs.
      (See STARTUP_FLOW.md proposed improvements.)
- [ ] **Tier-grouped startup logs** — `[HOT]` / `[COLD]` / `[OPS]`
      prefixes for clearer ops view.
- [ ] **Cleaner soft-fail logging** when provider creds are missing —
      single WARNING instead of ERROR + WARNING + ✅.

## Trading AI track (parallel)

Two docs govern this track:

- [trading-ai-build-plan.md](trading-ai-build-plan.md) — **strategic
  roadmap** (services, phases 1–9, reward engineering, deployment).
- [trading_subsystem_design.md](trading_subsystem_design.md) —
  **implementation contract** (Pydantic shapes, Protocols,
  folder layout, modularity guarantees). Read this before writing
  trading-subsystem code.

The data platform's Pre-Phase 3 Step 3 (MCP scaffold) is now done,
so all gates are clear to start the trading subsystem work.

### Phase TA-1 — Core backtest harness + canary strategy (LANDED 2026-05-16)

**Goal:** put a working backtest engine in place so every later
agent / strategy work has somewhere to land. Run the canary
(SMA crossover) end-to-end on real bronze data, prove the
reproducibility contract, and start the `agent_runs` registry.

Scope (per [trading_subsystem_design.md §10 Phase TA-1](trading_subsystem_design.md#phase-ta-1-core-harness--canary-strategy-next-session)):

- [x] `app/services/sim/` scaffold — 9 files, all per the design
      doc:
      - `schemas.py` — `Bar` Protocol, `Action`, `Position`, `Trade`,
        `RunMetrics`, `RunResult`, `BacktestConfig`, `PortfolioSnapshot`.
      - `strategy.py` — `Strategy` Protocol + `BaseStrategy`.
      - `context.py` — `Context` + `BarHistory` (deque-backed,
        per-bar indicator cache).
      - `portfolio.py` — `Portfolio` accounting with cash-clamped
        buys, position-clamped sells, set_position decomposition,
        per-bar mark-to-market, fp-epsilon residual cash clamp.
      - `fees.py` — Protocols + 5 implementations
        (`ZeroFees`, `PerShareFees`, `PercentFees`,
        `NextBarOpenFill`, `PercentSlippage`) + name registries.
      - `backtester.py` — `Backtester.run(strategy, config)` with
        snapshot pinning for the 1m bronze path, CH-fallback for
        the 1d path (no snapshot), strict interval-match check,
        git_sha capture.
      - `evaluator.py` — `StandardEvaluator` with interval-aware
        annualization, peak-to-trough drawdown, win-rate/profit-
        factor guards for degenerate inputs.
      - `registry.py` — `agent_runs` CH writer + `fetch_run` +
        `list_runs`. Best-effort `write_run` and strict
        `write_run_strict` variants.
      - `README.md` — folder contract, how-to-add-strategy/indicator/
        fees-model, modularity contracts, what's NOT in TA-1.
- [x] `app/indicators/` expanded:
      - `sma.py` — SMA via pandas rolling.mean().
      - `ema.py` — EMA via pandas ewm(adjust=False) matching every
        charting platform's convention.
      - `registry.py` — `get_indicator(name, **params)` +
        `list_indicators()`. Supports `sma`, `ema`, `rsi`, `macd`,
        `tsi`.
- [x] `SmaCrossoverStrategy` — interval-configurable canary
      (constructor takes `interval` so the same logic runs on `1d`,
      `1m`, or any future interval). Long-only, full-position-on-
      cross-up / full-exit-on-cross-down, position_size_pct
      defaults to 0.95.
- [x] `agent_runs` CH table wired into `init_schema()`. 24 columns
      including snapshot_id, git_sha, JSON config + JSON full
      metrics for the full reproducibility pin.
- [x] CLI `scripts/run_backtest.py` + `configs/canary.yaml`. YAML
      → `BacktestConfig`, strategy loader, pretty metrics output,
      `--no-write` / `--quiet` flags.
- [x] **Tests (39/39 green):**
      - `tests/test_sim_unit.py` — 38 unit tests covering schemas
        round-trip, both indicators against known math, registry
        name resolution, BarHistory eviction, Context indicator
        caching + per-bar invalidation, Context.log capture,
        Portfolio buy/sell/set_position/MTM/cash-clamp/pos-clamp,
        all fee + slippage models (including the per-share min/max
        cap precedence), Evaluator (total return, max DD,
        degenerate-trade guards, no-variance Sharpe), SMA
        crossover (warmup hold, params validation, cross emission),
        Backtester (interval mismatch raise, end-to-end with
        stubbed source, deterministic re-run).
      - `tests/integration/test_sim_real_bronze.py` — runs the
        canary against production AAPL minute bronze (RTH of
        2024-08-01), asserts snapshot_id captured, git_sha captured,
        equity curve populated, final equity in sane band.
      - `test_strategy_is_pure` — AST-walks every module reachable
        from `app/services/sim/strategies/*.py` and asserts none
        sit under `app.db.*` or `app.providers.*`. Same pattern as
        the existing `test_lake_route_does_not_import_clickhouse`.
      - `test_backtester_deterministic` — same inputs → same
        metrics + same equity curve + same trades.

**Gate (GREEN 2026-05-16):**

```bash
$ poetry run python scripts/run_backtest.py --config configs/canary.yaml
  Run: 507b6c6b-a4df-4a2e-adab-3bc6c4b0a8cc
  Strategy: sma_crossover v0.1
  Window:   2023-01-01 .. 2024-12-31  (1d, ['AAPL'])
  Snapshot: (none — CH path)
  Git SHA:  b70049be8576
  Starting capital  $     40,000.00
  Final equity      $     41,059.91
  Total return               +2.65%
  Sharpe ratio                0.305
  Max drawdown               -5.90%
  N trades                        5
```

Two consecutive runs of the canary produced **bit-for-bit identical
metrics** (total_return = 0.026497749999999654, sharpe_ratio =
0.3052698765608661, final_equity = 41059.90999999999). Both rows
landed in `agent_runs`. Reproducibility is proven at the production-
data level.

**Note for daily on `1d` path:** snapshot_id is currently empty
because CH `ohlcv_daily` has no snapshot semantics. Daily bronze
table (Phase 1 deferred item) is the path to full daily-tier
reproducibility — until then daily-interval backtests are
reproducible only via `git_sha` + `strategy_version` + `config`
identity, not via Iceberg snapshot pinning. **1m bronze path
pins snapshot fully and is the canonical training data source.**

### Phase TA-2 — LLM-driven strategy + agent self-evaluation MCP (LANDED 2026-05-17)

- [x] `app/services/sim/strategies/llm_agent.py` — `LLMAgentStrategy`
      wrapping Claude via the official `anthropic` SDK. Implements
      the `Strategy` Protocol directly (not via BaseStrategy) so it
      can manage its own setup/teardown for the API client + cache.
      - **Response caching** in local SQLite keyed on
        `sha256(model || system_prompt || user_prompt)`. Same prompt
        → cache hit → zero API cost. Cache persists across processes
        so a replay tomorrow is free.
      - **Cost-bounded by construction.** Strategy holds during
        warmup (no API call); cost per bar = at most one API call
        on first run, zero on replay. `_CallStats` accounts
        api_calls / cache_hits / parse_failures / api_failures
        for observability.
      - **Errors degrade to `hold()`** — API failure (rate limit,
        network), parse failure (model wrapped JSON in prose, model
        returned nonsense), or missing API key in setup. The
        backtest continues; we'd rather emit a measurable run than
        crash.
      - **Deterministic by default** — `temperature=0.0` removes
        randomness; combined with response caching, the same
        config produces an identical `agent_runs` row on replay.
      - **Pluggable indicators** in the prompt — `IndicatorSpec`
        list in params lets the operator (or another agent) tune
        what signals Claude sees without code changes.
      - **Action parsing**: tolerant JSON-object extraction
        (finds first `{...}` in the response) — robust to model
        wrapping JSON in prose despite system-prompt instructions.

- [x] `app/mcp/tools/sim.py` — two new MCP tools:
      - **`run_backtest(strategy_name, strategy_params, config,
        write_to_registry=True)`** → `RunMetrics`. Supports
        `sma_crossover` and `llm_agent`. This is the
        agent-iteration tool — an LLM can propose a strategy
        config, run it, see the metrics, then propose a different
        config.
      - **`list_strategy_runs(strategy_name, limit)`** → list of
        slim rows from `agent_runs`. The "how have my runs
        performed" tool. JSON-safe coercion of datetime / UUID
        columns so the agent gets serializable data.

- [x] `configs/llm_agent.yaml` — sample LLM-strategy config (AAPL
      2024 daily, SMA + RSI in context, Claude Sonnet 4.6 at
      temperature 0). Documents cost expectation (~$0.50-0.75 per
      full-year run on Sonnet pricing; replays are free).

- [x] **Tests (17 new + 2 MCP tool tests = 19/19 green):**
      - `tests/test_llm_agent_unit.py` (16 cases):
        - JSON extraction (strict, prose-wrapped, garbage).
        - Cache-key determinism + model-name sensitivity.
        - SQLite cache: roundtrip + miss + persistence across reopens.
        - Warmup → no API calls; bars past warmup → exactly N calls.
        - **Replay produces all cache hits, zero API calls.**
        - Action emission: buy-when-flat, buy-ignored-when-long,
          sell-with-position, sell-ignored-when-flat.
        - Parse failure → hold + stat increment.
        - API failure → hold + stat increment + cache NOT written.
        - position_size_pct clamps LLM-suggested oversize.
        - Two independent runs sharing one cache produce
          identical action sequences (reproducibility gate).
      - `tests/test_mcp_sim.py` (5 cases):
        - Both tools advertised in `list_tools`.
        - `run_backtest` against `sma_crossover` + stubbed bars
          end-to-end through MCP — returns valid RunMetrics dict.
        - Unknown strategy → MCP-side error.
        - `list_strategy_runs` returns slim view; datetimes are
          isoformat strings.
        - `limit > 200` clamps silently.

- [x] **End-to-end live verification** via official MCP client:
        ```
        25 tools advertised
        run_backtest(sma_crossover, AAPL 2024 Q3)
          → n_trades=1, total_return=+3.60%, sharpe=2.02,
            final_equity=$41,440.53
        list_strategy_runs(limit=3) → 3 rows including the
          just-completed run + the 2 reproducible runs from TA-1
          (+2.65% identical metrics)
        ```

**DEFERRED:** end-to-end live verification against real Anthropic API.
Pre-flight checks passed (smoke config prepared at
[configs/llm_agent_smoke.yaml](../configs/llm_agent_smoke.yaml),
unit tests cover the API-call path with stubs, env-var loading
verified). Awaiting `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in
`/Users/licaris/dev/stockalert/.env`. Cost when done: ~$0.05 for
smoke (45 trading days AAPL), ~$0.50 for full-year. Tracked in
[ISSUES.md `ta2-live-anthropic-run-deferred`](ISSUES.md).

**The agent self-evaluation loop is live** (in stub form — proven by
the 21 unit + MCP tests + the reproducibility regression).
An LLM agent connected
to this server can:

  1. `list_bronze_symbols` → discover the universe
  2. `get_bronze_bars(symbol, start, end)` → look at history
  3. `run_backtest({strategy_name: "llm_agent", ...})` → test
     its own hypothesis (or one it generated)
  4. `list_strategy_runs(strategy_name)` → compare with past attempts
  5. iterate

…with real production data, full reproducibility, and zero API cost
on replays. **This is the foundation Trading-AI Phases 3+ build on.**

### Phase TA-3.1 — Indicator math expansion (LANDED 2026-05-17)

Adds the four indicators TA-3's strategies need + the
[indicator_exposure_design.md](indicator_exposure_design.md) doc
covering how indicators are computed and served (Pattern A:
compute-on-read via a single `IndicatorReader`; gold-tier
pre-compute deferred to Phase 6).

- [x] `app/indicators/wma.py` — `WMA` (linear-weight MA).
- [x] `app/indicators/atr.py` — `ATR` (Wilder's smoothing).
      Requires `high` + `low` series in addition to `close`.
- [x] `app/indicators/bollinger.py` — `BollingerBands`. `compute()`
      returns the middle band (SMA); `compute_full()` returns dict
      of `{upper, middle, lower, bandwidth, percent_b}` — same
      multi-output convention as MACD.
- [x] `app/indicators/stochastic.py` — `StochasticOscillator`.
      `compute()` returns smoothed `%K`; `compute_full()` returns
      `{k, d}` for both signal lines in one pass.
- [x] `app/indicators/registry.py` updated — `INDICATOR_REGISTRY`
      now has 9 entries: sma, ema, wma, rsi, macd, tsi, stochastic,
      atr, bollinger. Strategies reach all by name via
      `ctx.indicator(name, **params)`.
- [x] `tests/test_indicators_ta3.py` — 20 cases covering math
      correctness on hand-crafted series, warmup behavior, param
      validation, multi-output `compute_full` shapes, registry
      resolution.
- [x] `docs/indicator_exposure_design.md` (NEW) — full architectural
      design for the upcoming exposure layer. Three patterns
      compared (compute-on-read / gold features / cached); decision
      to ship Pattern A now and defer B to Phase 6; concrete folder
      layout, Pydantic shapes, HTTP routes, MCP tools, dashboard
      migration path, multi-output convention, testing strategy.
- [x] `docs/README.md` + doc-relationship diagram updated.
- [x] `app/indicators/README.md` — indicator catalog refreshed
      with all 9 indicators by family (MA / Momentum / Volatility),
      multi-output convention documented.

**No exposure layer yet — that's TA-3.2.** The math is in place and
all consumers (`Context.indicator`, the existing `INDICATOR_REGISTRY`,
the LLM strategy's `IndicatorSpec`) can already request the new
indicators by name. Next commit builds `IndicatorReader` + HTTP
routes + MCP tools so the dashboard and agents can see them too.

### Phase TA-3.2 — Indicator exposure layer (LANDED 2026-05-17)

Per [indicator_exposure_design.md §4](indicator_exposure_design.md#4-concrete-design-ta-3-implementation):

- [x] **Pydantic shapes** in `app/services/readers/schemas.py`:
      `IndicatorValue` (timestamp + Optional[float]),
      `IndicatorSeries` (named series with values + label +
      params echo), `IndicatorChartData` (bars + multiple
      series + optional snapshot_id). One contract; HTTP routes
      and MCP tools both produce these byte-identical shapes.

- [x] **`IndicatorReader`** in
      `app/services/readers/indicator_reader.py` — single source
      of truth for indicator computation across all consumers.
      - `get_series(symbol, indicator, params, start, end, interval, provider)`
        returns one canonical `IndicatorSeries`. Multi-output
        indicators return only the canonical component
        (middle band / %K / MACD line).
      - `get_chart_data(symbol, indicator_specs, start, end, interval, provider)`
        returns `IndicatorChartData` with bars + N series.
        Multi-output indicators decompose into one
        `IndicatorSeries` per component
        (`bollinger_upper` / `bollinger_middle` / etc.).
      - Bar source resolution: `interval='1m'` → `BronzeReader`
        + snapshot_id pinning; everything else → `BarReader` with
        `LiveBar` → `BronzeBar` conversion. Uniform response shape.
      - Error semantics: single-indicator `get_series` raises
        `ValueError` on unknown indicator; multi-indicator
        `get_chart_data` degrades to per-spec "error stubs" so
        one bad indicator doesn't kill a chart of five.

- [x] **HTTP routes** in `app/api/routes_indicators.py`:
      - `GET /api/indicators/series?symbol=&start=&end=&indicator=&interval=&params=<json>`
      - `POST /api/indicators/chart-data` with body
        `{symbol, start, end, interval, provider, indicators[]}`
      - Both wired into `main_api.py` via `include_router` under
        `/api` with the `Indicators` tag.

- [x] **MCP tools** in `app/mcp/tools/indicators.py`:
      - `compute_indicator(symbol, indicator, start, end, interval, params, provider)`
      - `compute_indicators(symbol, indicators[], start, end, interval, provider)`
      - `get_chart_data(symbol, interval, lookback_days, indicators[], provider)`
        — convenience wrapper that resolves `lookback_days` into
        an explicit window.
      - Registered via `app.mcp.server.register_all_tools`. Total
        MCP tools advertised: **28** (was 25).

- [x] **Tests `tests/test_indicator_exposure.py`** — 24 cases:
      - 5 helper-fn cases (`_bars_to_df`, `_pd_series_to_indicator_values`
        with NaN-to-None + reindex-on-length-mismatch,
        `_format_label` including the prefix-strip on
        `bollinger_upper` → "BB Upper").
      - 4 `get_series` cases (SMA basic, empty bars, Bollinger
        canonical-only, unknown indicator raises).
      - 5 `get_chart_data` cases (multi-indicator, Bollinger →
        5 series, Stochastic → 2 series, MACD → 3 series, unknown
        indicator surfaces as an error stub instead of crashing).
      - 1 ATR-uses-H-L case.
      - 4 HTTP route cases (basic series, 400 on unknown indicator,
        400 on malformed params JSON, multi-indicator chart-data).
      - 4 MCP tool cases (discovery, compute_indicator,
        compute_indicators decomposes bollinger, get_chart_data
        lookback resolution).
      - **1 cross-consumer consistency gate**: same SMA(7) query
        through HTTP route AND MCP tool produces byte-identical
        `IndicatorSeries` values. Locks in the single-source-of-
        truth property at the regression-test level.

- [x] **End-to-end live verification** against real production AAPL:

      ```bash
      $ curl POST /api/indicators/chart-data with SMA(20) +
        Bollinger(20, 2.0) + RSI(14)
        → 44 bars, 7 series:
            sma                  last=227.07 @ 2024-08-30
            bollinger_upper      last=229.97
            bollinger_middle     last=227.07  (= SMA, math check ✓)
            bollinger_lower      last=224.16
            bollinger_bandwidth  last=0.03   (3% — quiet period)
            bollinger_percent_b  last=0.83   (price near upper band)
            rsi                  last=65.77
      ```

      Same query via MCP `compute_indicators` returns IDENTICAL
      values (per cross-consumer test + reconfirmed live).

**The TA-3.2 gate is GREEN.** The dashboard can render indicator
overlays via `POST /api/indicators/chart-data`. LLM agents over MCP
can call `compute_indicators` / `compute_indicator` / `get_chart_data`
and get the same Pydantic shape. Both surfaces use the same
`IndicatorReader` — single source of truth for indicator math.

### Phase TA-3.3 — RSI Extreme Reversion strategy (LANDED 2026-05-17)

Mean-revert baseline — buy on oversold, exit on neutral recovery.
First comparison ground for the trend-following SMA canary.

- [x] `app/services/sim/strategies/rsi_reversion.py` —
      `RsiReversionStrategy` via `BaseStrategy`. Long-only,
      interval-configurable.
      - Entry: `len(history) >= rsi_period + 2` AND no position
        AND `rsi(period) < oversold_threshold` → BUY
        `floor(cash * position_size_pct / price)` integer shares.
      - Exit: position held AND `rsi(period) > exit_threshold` →
        SELL full position.
      - Param validation: oversold < exit (otherwise the strategy
        would buy and sell the same bar).
- [x] `configs/rsi_reversion.yaml` — AAPL 2023-2024 daily,
      RSI(14), oversold=30, exit=50, $40k start.
- [x] CLI loader + MCP `run_backtest` `strategy_name` literal +
      `_instantiate` updated.
- [x] Tests `tests/test_rsi_reversion.py` — 12 strategy cases:
      param validation (overlap + equal thresholds), warmup
      hold, buy-on-dip, no-buy-when-long, no-buy-when-RSI-high,
      sell-on-recovery, no-sell-when-flat, integer-share sizing,
      zero-buy-when-cash-insufficient, metadata fields, Strategy
      Protocol satisfaction. Plus the existing structural purity
      gate (`test_strategy_is_pure`) still passes — RsiReversion
      doesn't import `app.db.*` / `app.providers.*`.
- [x] **Real-data run** — AAPL daily 2023-01-01 → 2024-12-31:
      - **12 trades, 33% win rate, -0.13% return, Sharpe 0.015,
        max DD -6.17%.**
      - **First baseline comparison vs SMA Crossover** on the
        same window: SMA got +2.65% / 5 trades / Sharpe 0.305.
        RSI Reversion fires 2.4× more often but underperforms on
        this trending stock — expected (bare RSI mean-revert is
        a known mediocre signal in trends). This data point
        anchors the TA-3.6 bake-off.

### Phase TA-3.4 — Bollinger Mean-Revert strategy (LANDED 2026-05-17)

Volatility-envelope mean-revert baseline — complementary to the
RSI-threshold variant. Different signal source, different trades,
different PnL profile.

- [x] `app/services/sim/strategies/bollinger_mean_revert.py` —
      `BollingerMeanRevertStrategy` via `BaseStrategy`. Long-only,
      interval-configurable.
      - Entry: `close <= lower_band` AND flat → BUY
        `floor(cash * pct / price)` integer shares.
      - Exit: `close >= middle_band` (SMA midline) AND long →
        SELL full position.
      - SMA midline via `ctx.indicator("sma", period=...)` for
        single-source-of-truth; rolling stdev computed locally
        with `ddof=0` (matches `BollingerBands.compute_full`).
- [x] Test `test_strategy_bands_match_bollinger_indicator` pins
      the math equivalence: the strategy's internal bands MUST
      match what `BollingerBands.compute_full` produces. If
      these diverge, the strategy and dashboard would show
      different bands for the same window.
- [x] `configs/bollinger_mean_revert.yaml` — AAPL 2023-2024
      daily, period=20, std=2.0.
- [x] CLI + MCP `run_backtest` loaders updated (4 strategies
      total: sma_crossover, llm_agent, rsi_reversion,
      bollinger_mean_revert).
- [x] Tests `tests/test_bollinger_mean_revert.py` — 11 strategy
      cases: warmup, entry on lower-band touch, no-buy-when-long,
      no-buy-when-close-above-lower-band, exit on middle-band
      recovery, no-sell-when-flat, integer-share sizing,
      zero-buy-when-cash-insufficient, bands-equivalence
      regression, metadata, Strategy Protocol. Plus the
      structural purity gate. All 12 green.
- [x] **Real-data run** (AAPL daily 2023-2024):
      - **12 trades, 50% win rate, -1.89% return, Sharpe -0.188,
        max DD -7.82%.**
      - Profit factor 0.778 (losers > winners despite the 50%
        win rate). Classic mean-revert problem in trending
        markets: small winners reverting to mean, big losers
        when the trend continues against you.

### TA-3.x running comparison (updated through 3.4)

| Strategy | Trades | Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Win Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sma_crossover` (canary) | 5 | +2.65% | 0.305 | -5.90% | 0% |
| `rsi_reversion` | 12 | -0.13% | 0.015 | -6.17% | 33% |
| `bollinger_mean_revert` | 12 | -1.89% | -0.188 | -7.82% | 50% |

Same window (AAPL daily 2023-01-01 → 2024-12-31), same fees
(per_share=$0.005, min=$1.00), same slippage (next bar open),
same $40k start. SMA Crossover's 0% win rate + positive return
is the trend-follower signature (rare wins are huge); the
mean-revert pair's higher win rates with worse total return is
the mean-revert-in-trend signature (small wins, big losses).

### Phase TA-3.5+ — Roadmap

- **TA-3.5**: EMA Crossover strategy (faster signal A/B vs SMA canary).
- **TA-3.6**: All 4 baselines on the same window → final
  comparison table + journal write-up. Anchors performance
  metrics before any LLM run.

### Phase TA-4+ — Roadmap

Detailed in [trading_subsystem_design.md §10](trading_subsystem_design.md#10-phasing):

- **TA-4** — Multi-timeframe strategies (declare
  `intervals=['1d', '1h']`) + `screener` service for universe
  scanning.
- **TA-5** — RL agent (PPO). Same `Strategy` Protocol — the harness
  doesn't know it's RL. Reward = stepped Sharpe contribution.
- **TA-6+** — Paper trading → live. Same `Strategy` class, different
  `Executor`. Kill switches mandatory before any live execution.

## Decision log

Persistent decisions made during the build. New decisions append at the
bottom with a date.

- **2026-05-14** — Single S3 bucket `stock-lake`, separate by prefix.
  One bucket per env (dev/prod) if/when we add staging environments.
- **2026-05-14** — Glue Data Catalog over self-hosted Iceberg REST
  catalog. Re-evaluate when we need data branching (Nessie).
- **2026-05-14** — Separate bronze table per provider (not a single
  table with provider partition). Schemas drift.
- **2026-05-14** — Bars only. No tick/quote data.
- **2026-05-14** — Polygon = corp-actions source of truth. Silver
  carries both raw and adjusted price columns.
- **2026-05-14** — Iceberg snapshot pinning is mandatory for every
  saved model. `model_training_runs` registry in ClickHouse.
- **2026-05-14** — Watermark ledger (`lake_archive_watermarks`)
  becomes `ingestion_runs` — audit/ops only. Iceberg `MERGE INTO`
  is the correctness layer.
- **2026-05-14** — Bucket is `stock-lake-562741918372-us-east-1-an`
  (existing, not the literal `stock-lake` name in earlier plans —
  that name is globally taken). All plan docs reference the name via
  `${STOCK_LAKE_BUCKET}` so this doesn't require doc rewrites.
- **2026-05-14** — IAM user `stock-lake-ingest` (account 562741918372).
  Policy covers bucket-config + scoped Glue access to database
  `stock_lake` only. Production agent containers will get a separate,
  tighter role per service (ingest write-only, silver-builder
  read/write, evaluator read-only).
- **2026-05-14** — Existing S3 data at
  `raw/provider=polygon-flatfiles/kind=minute/` (1,325 files,
  2021-2026) will be `add_files`-imported into `bronze.polygon_minute`
  during Phase 1. Treated as `polygon` provider in silver precedence —
  Polygon flat files are Polygon's authoritative SIP data.
- **2026-05-14** — Lifecycle policy loosened: bronze IA transition
  pushed 60d → 180d; silver IA transition removed (silver stays
  Standard indefinitely). Reason: Polygon data is expensive to re-
  acquire (no ongoing subscription planned), and storage cost is
  pennies at our scale. Compaction will target only the last 90 days
  to avoid early-deletion fees against IA/Glacier IR minimum-storage
  durations. Re-tighten when bronze exceeds 500 GB or monthly bill
  warrants.
- **2026-05-14** — Doc discipline (now in
  [docs/README.md working agreement](README.md)): every microservice
  folder has a `README.md` (what it does, owns, contract, how to
  test). Docs in `docs/` get updated in the same change as the code
  that prompts them, not later. Drift breaks the pick-up-where-we-
  left-off promise.
- **2026-05-14** — Historical import switched from `add_files` to
  Athena server-side INSERT. Reason: laptop-side rewrite estimated at
  8 hours (home-bandwidth-bound); Athena finished in 28 min for $0.16.
  Athena workgroup `primary` (engine v3). DDL must use Hive
  backticks; DML must use Trino double quotes. The same query can't
  use both styles. Athena INSERT writer respects
  `write.target-file-size-bytes` natively, so OPTIMIZE after a
  fresh INSERT is typically a no-op.
- **2026-05-14** — Data-quality finding: ~80k Polygon flat-file rows
  (0.0038% of 2.1B) have NULL symbol. They have valid OHLCV values
  but no ticker → unusable. Filtered at the bronze boundary
  (`WHERE symbol IS NOT NULL AND "timestamp" IS NOT NULL`). The
  silver-layer `bar_quality` job should track this rate ongoing.
- **2026-05-14** — `BronzeIcebergSink` uses `append`, not `overwrite`.
  Rationale: PyIceberg's `overwrite(filter=...)` reads existing files
  to determine which rows to delete. On a 35-GB table that's hundreds
  of MB of I/O per call — unacceptable for a daily nightly cadence or
  any future live writer. Idempotency moves UPSTREAM: nightly job has
  its watermark; future live writer has a "last-flushed-ts" cursor.
  If duplicates ever do occur, silver's provider precedence + dedup
  handles them at silver-build time.
- **2026-05-14** — Athena DELETE with partition + symbol filter is
  the maintenance tool for cleaning bronze (vs PyIceberg's `delete`
  which scans the whole table). Used for test-row cleanup; available
  for operator use.
- **2026-05-15** — `BronzeIcebergSink` refactored to be
  table-agnostic. One class accepts a target `Table` + an
  `accepted_providers: set[(provider, kind)]` filter. Factories
  `for_polygon_minute()` and `for_schwab_minute()` cover the
  common cases. Avoids parallel per-provider sink classes; new
  bronze tables get a factory method, not a new class.
- **2026-05-15** — Schwab REST pricehistory does not return `vwap`
  or `trade_count`. Bronze schema keeps those columns nullable so
  the same canonical shape is shared across providers; silver's
  precedence rules treat both providers uniformly without
  conditional schemas.
- **2026-05-15** — Schwab's pricehistory API has a known quirk
  where passing `period` together with explicit `startDate`/`endDate`
  can yield HTTP 400 ("Enddate is before startDate"). Cost us
  2026-04-03 in this Phase 2 backfill. Fix deferred — silver
  dedup handles single-provider single-day gaps gracefully; can
  re-pull the day after fixing `historical_df`.
- **2026-05-16** — Service folders grouped by **domain, not provider**.
  `app/services/` split into `bronze/`, `ingest/`, `live/`, `journal/`,
  `legacy/`. Rationale: a provider is a configuration parameter (set
  via `STREAM_PROVIDER` / `HISTORY_PROVIDER`), not a service boundary.
  Bronze is multi-provider via factory methods; ingest jobs are
  per-provider but share the `Sink` Protocol. Provider-grouped folders
  would fight the architecture and force duplicate code for
  multi-provider services like watchlist + bronze.
- **2026-05-16** — Startup uses `_safe_start()` so each subsystem can
  fail independently. Journal sync expiring its Schwab token, or
  watchlist failing to subscribe, does not block nightly bronze
  ingest, HTTP routes, or other subsystems. Foundation tasks
  (CH schema init, OHLCV batch writer) stay non-isolated by design —
  if those fail the app has nothing useful to serve.
- **2026-05-16** — Journal service formally scoped Schwab-only.
  README in `app/services/journal/` documents this: account/trade
  data only makes sense from the broker where trades execute. If a
  future user uses a different broker, journal would become a
  multi-provider service with provider-specific implementations;
  not in scope today.
- **2026-05-16** — Alpaca deferred indefinitely. Code paths remain
  (provider abstraction supports it) but Alpaca creds are not
  exercised. Provider switching is `DATA_PROVIDER` env-only.
- **2026-05-16** — MCP server will be **mounted on the existing
  FastAPI app at `/mcp`** rather than run as a separate process.
  Single process for local dev simplicity; split out later if/when
  we run the trading-AI services in their own containers. Same
  services power both HTTP routes (humans/UI) and MCP tools (agents).
- **2026-05-16** — Lake reads must work without ClickHouse. Agents
  doing historical/training reads should hit `BronzeReader` → S3 +
  Iceberg directly; CH is for live/recent only. This decouples
  agent capability from CH availability. New routes
  (`/api/lake/*`) and MCP tools route to bronze without touching CH.
- **2026-05-16** — Nightly auto-catchup. Both `refresh_polygon_lake_yesterday`
  and `refresh_schwab_bronze_yesterday` now detect gaps and fill them
  on each run, using a new helper `app/services/bronze/gaps.py`
  (`latest_bronze_date` + `missing_weekdays`). Critical implementation
  detail: gap-detection uses **Eastern-time trading-day**, not UTC date.
  Polygon flat-files for "May 14 trading day" include after-hours bars
  whose UTC timestamp falls on May 15; using UTC date would falsely
  advance the "latest day" counter and skip the May 15 trading day on
  the next nightly run. ET-date matches flat-file naming + Schwab's
  pricehistory windows. 8 unit tests cover the date math; existing
  integration tests still pass.
- **2026-05-15** — Renamed Polygon-nightly env vars to match the
  Schwab pattern (`<PROVIDER>_NIGHTLY_*`):
  `LAKE_ARCHIVE_ENABLED` → `POLYGON_NIGHTLY_ENABLED`,
  `LAKE_ARCHIVE_RUN_HOUR_UTC` → `POLYGON_NIGHTLY_RUN_HOUR_UTC`,
  `NIGHTLY_LAKE_SYMBOLS` → `POLYGON_NIGHTLY_SYMBOLS`,
  `NIGHTLY_LAKE_KIND` → `POLYGON_NIGHTLY_KIND`. Reason: the old
  names predated the bronze-Iceberg migration (when there was only
  one "lake archive" — Polygon's raw S3 dump) and were inconsistent
  with the per-provider pattern. Settings attributes renamed
  identically. Internal symbols like the helper function
  `resolve_nightly_lake_symbols` and the module file
  `nightly_lake_refresh.py` kept their names — they're module
  internals, not the inconsistency the user flagged. Hard rename
  with no backward-compat shim (single-user codebase; .env files
  updated in the same change).
- **2026-05-16** — TA code split into three layers, each a candidate
  microservice boundary later:
  `app/indicators/` (pure math: price → series),
  `app/signals/` (pattern detectors: price + indicator → event),
  and a future `app/strategies/` (compose signals → trade decision).
  `app/divergence.py` moved into `app/signals/` to enforce the
  separation; it returns events, not series, so it was never an
  indicator. Detectors are pure functions taking tuning knobs as
  arguments (not reading `settings` directly), so they're testable in
  isolation — the caller (`services/live/monitor_service.py`) pulls
  config and passes it in.
- **2026-05-14** — Write cadence vs partition layout decoupled.
  Writer cadence stays daily (one append per trading day's Polygon
  flat file; the nightly job and live 5-min flush both write
  incrementally). Iceberg `month(ts)` partitioning + post-write
  compaction is what produces the monthly on-disk layout — not a
  monthly writer. Phase 1 makes compaction a first-class task, not
  maintenance. Avoids the "wait until month-end to write" trap that
  breaks incremental ingest.
